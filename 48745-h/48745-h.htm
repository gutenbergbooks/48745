<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In this, as in the two preceding volumes of the series—The
Half-Back and For the Honor of the School—an attempt
is made to show that athletics rightly indulged in
is beneficial to the average boy and is an aid rather than a
detriment to study. In it, too, as in the previous books,
a plea is made for honesty and simplicity in sports. There
is a tendency in this country to-day to give too great an
importance to athletics—to take it much too seriously—and
it is this tendency that should be guarded against,
especially among school and college youths. When athletics
ceases to be a pleasure and becomes a pursuit it
should no longer have a place in school or college life.</p>

<p>Many inquiries have been received as to whether Hillton
Academy really exists. It doesn’t. It is, instead, a
composite of several schools that the author knows of, and
is not unlike any one of a half dozen institutions which are
yearly turning out hundreds of honest, manly American
boys, stronger, sturdier, and more self-reliant for just such
trials and struggles as in the present volume fall to the
lot of Dick Hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

of Joel March, Outfield West, Wayne Gordon, and
their companions, this book is gratefully dedicated by</p>

<p class="title">CAPTAIN OF THE CREW</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE BOY ON THE BOX</small></h2>


<p>“Hillton! Hillton!”</p>

<p>The brakeman winked solemnly at the group of boys in
the end seats, withdrew his head, slammed the door and
crossed the swaying platforms to make a similar announcement
to the occupants of the car ahead. From the left
side of the train passengers caught a glimpse of a broad
expanse of meadow upon which tiny flecks of red flared
dully in the winter sunshine; of a distant grand stand,
bleak and desolate, against whose northern shoulder a drift
of snow snuggled as though seeking protection from its
enemy the sun; of two pairs of goal-posts gravely watching
each other from opposite ends of a long field; of a bit of
country road, a slowly rising hill, a little army of leafless
elms, and, last of all, crowning a promontory below which
the frozen Hudson sparkled, a group of old red brick buildings,
elbowing each other with friendly rivalry in an endeavor
to gain the post of honor and to be first seen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the outside world that traveled by train. That was Hillton
Academy.</p>

<p>There was a long warning shriek from the engine,
echoed back by the wooded slope of Mount Adam; a momentary
reverberating roar as the train crossed the little
viaduct; the whistle of air brakes; and then, as the train
came to a stop, a babel of boys’ voices. Some twenty
youths of assorted ages and sizes, laden with every description
of luggage, from golf bags and valises down to boxes
of figs and caramels purchased from the train-boy and still
uneaten, pushed and scrambled their way to the station
platform. The last trunk was slid from the baggage car,
and the conductor, portly and jovial, sang “All aboard!”
and waved a smiling good-by to the boys.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Pop! See you later!” “Don’t forget
that anti-fat, Pop!” And then, when the train had gained
speed, a slim junior danced along the platform waving a
bit of pasteboard exultingly under the conductor’s nose and
just out of his reach: “Hey, Pop! You didn’t get my
ticket! Stop the train! Stop the train!” An old joke
this, that never failed of applause. The conductor shook
his fist in simulated wrath, and the next instant, with
a farewell shriek of the whistle, the train was lost to
sight.</p>

<p>Beside the platform waited the coach, from the box
of which “Old Joe,” the driver, smiled a toothless welcome.
Each year held three red-letter days for “Old Joe,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
namely, the days preceding the commencement of the three
school terms, when the students, refreshed by recess or
vacation, returned in merry troops to Hillton—noisy, mischievous,
vexing, but ever admirable to the old stage-driver—and
taxed the capacity of the coach to the utmost, and
“Old Joe’s” patience to the limit. This was the first of the
red-letter days of the present year, which was as yet but
forty-eight hours old, and all day long the boys who had
been so fortunate as to return to their homes for the
Christmas recess had been piling from the trains to the
stage and from the stage to the steps of Academy Building.
And “Old Joe,” who loved the excitement of it
all, and worshiped everything, animate or inanimate, that
belonged to Hillton, was in his glory.</p>

<p>“Now, then, you young terrors, get aboard here. Can’t
wait all afternoon for you. This ain’t no ’commodating
train, and——”</p>

<p>“Hello, Joe, old chap; how’s your appetite?” “Still
able to sit up and take your meals, Joe?” “Say, fellows,
Old Joe’s looking younger every day.” “Give me a hand
up, Joe, and I’ll show you how to drive those old plugs of
yours.” “Please, Joe, you said I could sit on the box with
you this trip, don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Have to be next time, youngster; seat’s full a’ready.
How do, Mister Hope? Scramble out o’ here, sir, an’ give
Mister Hope your seat. Oh, is that you, Mister Nesbitt?
Well——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’ll sit back here,” answered the boy addressed as
Hope. “I can jump off quicker when we upset.”</p>

<p>“Hark to that,” growled the driver in pretended anger;
“an’ me forty-two years on this road an’ never no accident
yet. All aboard there! No, ye don’t, sir; no more room
atop. Trunks’ll go up next trip, sir. All right now. <em>Tlk!
Get ap!</em>”</p>

<p>The two stout grays, known popularly as “Spring
Halt” and “Spavin,” settled into their collars, and the
big stage, swaying comfortably on its leather springs, lumbered
around the corner into Station Road. From the interior
of the coach, where twelve youths had managed to
pack themselves into a space designed to hold but nine,
floated out a wild medley of shouts and laughter. On top,
two boys had secured the much-coveted places beside the
driver, while on the seat behind three others were perched.
When the little stone station had been left the boy who
occupied the other end of the driver’s seat, and whom
“Old Joe” had called “Mister Nesbitt,” leaned across the
intervening youth and addressed the driver:</p>

<p>“Now, Joe, let’s have the lines, old chap, and I’ll show
you a bit of fancy driving that’ll open your eyes. Come
now, like a nice old Joe.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t be askin’ for the reins, Mister Nesbitt,
sir. You know it’s agin the rules for the boys to drive.”</p>

<p>“What! Oh, rot, Joe! I never heard of such a rule.
Did you, Williams?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never,” replied the third occupant of the box. “Joe
dreamed it.”</p>

<p>“Of course you did, Joe. Come on, now; just let me
have them to the corner there. Don’t be a duffer, man.
Why, I can drive a pair bang up.” “Old Joe” cast a
deeply suspicious glance at the youth—and was lost.
Trevor Nesbitt assumed a look of angelic innocence and
sweetness and pleaded so eloquently with his blue eyes that
the driver grudgingly relinquished the lines.</p>

<p>“Mind ye now, Mister Nesbitt, just to the corner you
said.”</p>

<p>“Meaning around it, Joe, of course,” replied Nesbitt as
he adjusted the lines knowingly between his gloved fingers.
“Come, Spavin, cheer up, old laddie!” Williams, who had
been holding the long-lashed whip, now handed it to Nesbitt,
who sent the lash swirling over his head, and with a
quick movement snapped it loudly a few inches from
Spavin’s head. The result was instantaneous. The off
horse snorted loudly and leaped forward, and the other followed
suit. “Old Joe” snatched at the reins, but Nesbitt
held them out of reach.</p>

<p>“Don’t whip ’em, sir,” cried the old man, “please
don’t whip ’em; they ain’t used to it, sir.” Nesbitt
laughed gaily.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, Joe, I’ll not hurt them. But we
can’t put on side, old chap, unless we just touch them up
a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Crack</em> went the long lash again.</p>

<p>For several years the grays had traveled the road from
station to school and thence to the Eagle Tavern without
other persuasion than a cheery chirp or a sharp whistle
from “Old Joe,” or, upon rare occasions, a half-hearted
snap of the whip in no startling proximity to their ears.
To-day there was plainly something wrong, and so, after
a moment of bewildered consideration, they broke into a
long ungainly gallop, to the joy of the boy with the reins
and to the terror of “Old Joe.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Williams, this is something like, eh?” Nesbitt
sat up straight on the seat, tightened the lines and
grinned delightedly at his companion. “Old Joe” was
pleading excitedly for the whip.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, give me the whip now. I’m afeared for
you to have it. You might hit ’em, sir, accidental, an’
there’s no telling what they’d do. Mister Williams, sir,
just you hand it to me. <em>Stop him!</em>” But he had spoken
too late. Nesbitt brought the lash down smartly on the
broad back of the off horse, and the gallop changed to a
plunging run, the coach swaying awkwardly from side to
side. “Old Joe” reached forward desperately to wrest
the lines from the boy, but Williams interfered.</p>

<p>“Hands off, Joe,” cried Nesbitt, “or you’ll have us
over. Keep him quiet, Williams.”</p>

<p>From inside the stage came a babel of shouts, the exclamations
of alarm half drowned by the noise of the beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hoofs and the protesting creaks of the leather springs.
The horses with heads down, frightened at length by the
unwonted use of the whip, galloped madly. Nesbitt, smiling
and cool, sat straight and handled the lines with skill,
which at any other time would have won loud commendation
from “Old Joe.” But just at present that worthy
was too terrorized to appreciate aught but the fact that
the grays were apparently running away. He had a frightful
vision of an overturned coach, of mangled bodies, and
of everlasting disgrace. Yet he recognized the fact that
to take the lines away from Nesbitt by force, even had
such a thing been possible, would be the surest way to bring
about the very catastrophe he dreaded. And then he
glanced ahead down the frozen road and saw the sharp
turn but a short distance away.</p>

<p>The three youths on the seat behind had been watching
affairs at first with amusement and now with apprehension.
The boy in the center frowned and turned to one of his
companions.</p>

<p>“Who is that chap?” he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What! don’t you know ‘’Is ’Ighness’?”</p>

<p>“‘His Highness’? No, I don’t. Who is he; one of
our class?”</p>

<p>“No; he’s an upper middle chap; Trevor Nesbitt’s his
real name. The fellows call him ‘’Is ’Ighness’ because
he’s English. He’s a good sort, all right, but I wish he’d
let driving alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“So do I,” responded the boy at the other end of the
seat, “but”—a note of admiration creeping into his dubious
tones—“he knows how, all right!”</p>

<p>“But, I say, Hope,” cried the previous speaker, “look
there; we’ve got to go around that corner! Let’s say our
prayers.” Hope’s brows contracted as he glanced ahead;
then he slid from the seat, rested himself on his knee, clinging
tightly the while, and leaned over the back of the seat
ahead.</p>

<p>“Look here, can you get them around that turn?”</p>

<p>“Who’s that, Williams?” asked Nesbitt without looking
around.</p>

<p>“Dick Hope; he wants to know——”</p>

<p>“Tell him to shut up and sit down, Williams,” interrupted
Nesbitt calmly. Hope flushed angrily, but said no
more, crouching in his place between the seats with an idea
of lending a hand in case of disaster, although in just what
way he could be of use was far from clear. Nesbitt raised
to his feet, propping himself firmly, the reins tight wrapped
about his hands.</p>

<p>“Hold tight all,” he warned, “and bear to the right!”</p>

<p>With the turn but a few yards away he brought his
weight to bear on the lines, swaying from side to side with
the lurching coach, settling farther and farther back as the
horses lowered their heads to the command of the tugging
bits. Hope thought of “Old Joe” at that moment, and
glanced across at him. The stage-driver was silent now, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
cheeks white, his face drawn. Williams, too, was pale, and
his rigid attitude told more plainly than words that the
fun had ceased for him. Nesbitt alone of the three occupants
of the box appeared at ease. Hope could see the
warm color playing on his cheek, and——</p>

<p>“Easy, boys, easy!” Nesbitt called slowly, soothingly
to the horses, and then— Well, Hope was clutching
desperately at the boards in the grating; he saw the backs
of the straining animals turn at an angle to the stage,
heard the great wheels <em>slur-r-r</em> across the frozen ground,
felt the body of the coach sway far to the left, as though
it were on its way across the fence at that side, and opened
his eyes again to find a straight road ahead of them, and
to see Nesbitt settle himself into his seat once more. “Old
Joe” muttered an exclamation of relief. Hope again
leaned across Nesbitt’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I think you’ve shown off enough for to-day,” he said.
“Now pull those horses down—if you can.”</p>

<p>Nesbitt glanced back into the other’s face, an angry
light in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly attend to your own affairs?” he asked
with suspicious sweetness. Hope smiled in spite of his
anger.</p>

<p>“If you don’t think it’s my affair,” he replied, “maybe
you’ll acknowledge that the gentlemen ahead have something
to say about it.” Nesbitt looked up the road and
whistled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just my bally luck!” he murmured. “Professors!”
With straining arms he bore back on the lines. Little by
little the horses slackened speed, and at last dropped into
a trot, but not before the coach had swept by two very
serious-faced Hillton professors out for a walk, whose sharp
glances presaged trouble. Nesbitt handed over the lines
and whip to “Old Joe.”</p>

<p>“My luck again,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“An’ serves you right,” grunted the driver.</p>

<p>Hope crawled into his seat again. His companions were
busy explaining the course of events to the inhabitants of
the interior of the coach, or as many of them as could get
their heads out the doors, and ere the latter had run out
of questions the stage turned into the academy grounds
and crawled sedately up to the steps of Academy Building.</p>

<p>Hope leaped from the coach and hurried off to his
room, while the other boys, laughing and joking, clustered
about Nesbitt. “Wheels won’t do a thing to you,” one
lad assured him with a grin.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let it trouble you, Tommy,” he answered
gaily. “But, I say, Williams, who was that meddlesome
chap on the back seat?”</p>

<p>It was Williams’s turn to grin.</p>

<p>“The fellow you told to shut up, you mean?” Nesbitt
nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh, no one much; just Dick Hope, captain of the
crew.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>INTRODUCING DICK HOPE</small></h2>


<p>The sun was almost out of sight as Dick Hope crossed
the yard toward Masters Hall, and the shadows of the buildings,
stretching far over the ground, seemed to harbor
many little gusts of icy wind, and looked dark and dismal
in contrast with the broad expanse of golden, sun-bathed
marsh across the river. Dick pulled his coat closer about
him, ran up the old, worn granite steps of the dormitory,
and gained the hallway with a sense of comfort and homecoming.</p>

<p>Securing his key from the matron’s room, he leaped
up the first flight of narrow stairs and, half-way down the
corridor, unlocked a dingy door which bore a big black
figure 16, and, below it, a card with the inscription “Richard
Fowler Hope.” The room was filled with the mellow
light of the setting sun, and here and there the rays
were caught—by the glass doors of the bookcase, by the
metal top of the inkstand, or, less sharply, by the silver and
pewter mugs ranged along the mantel—and were thrown
back in golden blurs that dazzled the eyes.</p>

<p>Dick laid aside his coat and cap, took off his gloves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
thrusting his hands into his pocket, surveyed the apartment
smilingly. It was awfully jolly to get back, he thought
happily, as his gaze took in the shabby, comfortable furnishings
and the hundred and one objects about the room so
intimately connected with three and a half years of pleasant
school life. An array of worn and soberly bound books
lined an end of the leather-covered study table, and he
took one up and fluttered its pages between his fingers; it
was a good deal like shaking hands with an old friend.
With the volume still in his clasp he moved to the mantel
and examined the knickknacks thereon, the cups and photographs
and little china things, all cheap enough viewed from
a money standpoint, yet to Dick priceless from long possession.
He felt a momentary heart-flutter as his eyes fell
on one pewter mug ornately engraved with his name.</p>

<p>As he looked the mantel and wall faded from sight,
and he saw a stretch of cinder track, pecked by the spikes
of runners’ shoes; at a little distance a thin white tape. He
saw himself, head back, eyes staring, struggling desperately
for that white thread across the track. Again he heard the
thud and crunch of the St. Eustace runner’s feet almost
beside him; heard, far more dimly, the shouts of excited
onlookers, and again felt his effortful gasps as he gained
inch by inch. The captain of the track team had been
the first to reach him as the tape fluttered to the ground
and he turned, half reeling, onto the turf. And he had
thrown an arm about him and lowered him gently to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
welcome sod and had whispered three short words into his
ear, words that meant more than volumes of praise:</p>

<p>“<em>Good work, Dick!</em>”</p>

<p>The vision faded and the boy, with a sigh that expressed
more happiness than a laugh could have done,
turned away from the mantel. The crimson silk sash-curtains,
drawn to the sides of the two windows, glowed like
fire, but the shafts of sunlight had traveled up the walls
to the ceiling, and the study was growing dim. In the fireplace
a pile of wood and shavings was ready to light, and
Dick, scratching a match along the mantel edge, set it
ablaze and drew an easy chair to the hearth. With the
shabby school-book in his hands, he settled comfortably
against the cushions, and, his gaze on the leaping flames,
let his thoughts wander as they willed.</p>

<p>There was plenty to think of. Before him lay five of
the busiest, most important months of his school life,
months that would be filled with plenty of hard work, much
pleasure, and probably not a little worriment, and which
might be crowned with a double triumph for him, for his
hopes were set upon graduating at the head of his class and
upon turning out a crew which in the annual boat-race
with Hillton’s well-loved rival, St. Eustace, would flaunt the
crimson above the blue in a decisive victory. To attain
the first result many long hours of the hardest sort of study
would be necessary, while the last would require never-flagging
patience, tact, courage, and skill, and would demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
well-nigh every moment of his time not given to lessons.
The outlook did not, however, frighten him. He had returned
to school feeling strong and confident and eager to
begin his tasks.</p>

<p>When, the preceding June, after a sorrowful defeat by
St. Eustace, the members of the Hillton crew had met to
elect a new captain, Richard Hope had been chosen because
he above all other candidates possessed the directness
of purpose, the gift of leadership, and the untiring ability
for hard work requisite to form a winning eight from unpromising
material; even the defeated candidates for the
post, which at Hillton was the highest and most honorable
in the gift of the school, applauded the choice, and, with
a possible exception, honestly felt the pleasure they expressed.
The possible exception was Roy Taylor, one of
the best oarsmen at Hillton. Taylor had striven hard
for the captaincy and had accepted defeat with far less
graciousness than had the other three candidates, though
he had tried to hide his disappointment under a mask of
smiling indifference. The recollection of Roy Taylor was
this evening almost the only source of uneasiness to Dick
as he watched the mellow flames leap and glow.</p>

<p>Presently he pushed back his chair, lighted the drop-light
on the table and drew the blinds. It was almost supper
time. Throwing aside his coat, he unpacked his satchel,
distributing several presents about the study. Then, with
his toilet articles in hand, he opened the door into the bedroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and started back in surprise. Between the two narrow
iron bedsteads stood a pile of luggage. A dilapidated
tin trunk, painted in ludicrous imitation of yellow oak,
flanked a handsome leather portmanteau, while upon these
was piled a motley array of bundles and bags; a tennis
racquet and two cricket bats were tied together with three
brightly colored neckties; a battered golf bag fairly bristled
with sticks; a pair of once white flannel trousers were
tied about at the ankles with strings, and were doing duty
as a repository for discarded shoes, golf, tennis, and cricket
balls, and sundry other treasures. The improvised bag had
fallen open at the larger end and had disgorged a portion
of its contents in the manner of a huge, strangely formed
horn of plenty. Crowning all was a soiled clothes bag, vivid
with purple lilies on a yellow ground, whose contour told
plainly that it held books.</p>

<p>Quickly following his first moment of surprise came to
Dick a knowledge of what the presence of the luggage
meant, and his grin of amusement was succeeded by a
frown. The boy who had shared his quarters with him
at the beginning of the year had left the academy in
October, and Dick had held sole possession of the rooms
until now. He had been told that with the commencement
of the winter term he would have a roommate, but
until that moment he had forgotten the fact. He wondered
as he spluttered at the wash-stand what sort of a chap
his future chum was, and drew ill augury from the queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
collection of luggage. With towel in hand he walked
around the pile and studied the labels and the initials that
adorned trunks and bags. The former were numerous;
plainly the owner of the yellow tin trunk had traveled,
for a Cunard steamship label flanked a red-lettered legend
“Wanted,” and the two were elbowed by the paper disk
of a Geneva hotel. The initials “T. N.” told him nothing,
save that the owner’s name was probably Tom. Well, Tom
was a good enough name, he thought, as he applied the
brush vigorously to his brown hair, and as for the rest he
would soon learn.</p>

<p>Drawing on his coat and lowering the light, he hurried
across to Warren Hall and supper. The dining-room
was well filled, and as he made his way to his seat at a
far table he was obliged to return a dozen greetings, and
had he paused in response to every detaining hand that
was stretched out he would scarcely have reached his seat
in the next half hour. It was pleasant to be back again
among all those good fellows, he thought as he laughingly
pulled himself free from the clutches of his friends, and
pleasanter still to know that they were glad to have him
back. His heart beat a little faster than usual, and his
cheeks were a little more flushed as he clapped his nearest
neighbor on the shoulder and sank into his chair, only to
leave it the next moment and detour the table to shake
hands with Professor Longworth, who had bowed to him
smilingly across the board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Vacation seems to have agreed with you, Hope; you
look as hearty as you please. You must let Mr. Beck
see you before the bloom wears off; he’d rather see one
of you boys looking fit than come into a legacy.”</p>

<p>“I’m feeling fine, sir,” laughed Dick, “and I’m so
glad to get back that even trigonometry doesn’t scare me.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” replied the professor grimly. “Just wait
until you see what I’ve got ready for you.”</p>

<p>Dick was soon busy satisfying a huge appetite and listening
to the veritable avalanche of information and inquiry
that was launched at him.</p>

<p>“St. Eustace has chosen the negative side in the debate,
Hope, and old Tinker’s tickled to death; says he’s
certain we’ll win, because——” “Dick, come up to my
cave Saturday afternoon, will you? Burns isn’t coming
back, and he’s written me to sell his stuff, and we’re going
to have an auction; Smith junior’s going to be auctioneer,
and we’re going to hang a red flag out the window,
and——” “Did you hear about that upper middle chap
they call ‘’Is ’Ighness’? He nearly upset the coach this
afternoon, they say, and Professor Wheeler’s going to put
him on probation. Chalmers says he told Wheeler
that——” “We’ve got some dandy hockey games fixed,
Hope; Shrewsburg’s coming down Monday next if the ice
holds and St. Eustace about the first of Feb.” “You
ought to’ve been with us, Hope, last Saturday. We went
fishing through the ice, and Jimmy Townsend caught four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
regular whales; and we cooked them at the hut on the
island and had a fine feast, only the silly things wouldn’t
get quite done through, and tasted rather nasty if you
didn’t hold your nose and swallow quick.” “Say, have
you seen Carl Gray? He told me to tell you that he’d be
up to your room after supper; wants to see you most particular,
he says. Don’t forget I told you, ’cause I promised
I would.” “I’m going to try for the boat, Hope. When
shall I report?” “When you make the crew, youngster,
I’ll win a scholarship; and that won’t happen in a thousand
years!” “Speaking of the crew, Dick, Roy Taylor says
we’re goners this year.”</p>

<p>Dick helped himself generously to the blackberry jam.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” he asked calmly.</p>

<p>“Says we haven’t got good material.”</p>

<p>“If we had seven other fellows as good as Taylor we’d
be all right,” responded Dick. “And as it is, we’ve turned
out cracking fine crews before this from even less promising
stuff. Well, I’m off. Never mind what Todd says, Jimmy;
show up with the others and have a try. I only wish there
were other chaps as plucky!”</p>

<p>And amid mingled groans of reproach and derision
Dick pushed back his chair and left the hall. When he
reached the second floor of Masters he saw that the door
of Number 16 was ajar, and that some one had turned up
the light.</p>

<p>“Gray’s waiting, I guess,” he told himself. “Wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
what he wants?” He pushed the door open, and then
paused in surprise on the threshold.</p>

<p>In Dick’s big green leather armchair, his slippered feet
to the blaze, a book in his hands, reclined very much at
his ease the youth who had driven the stage-coach.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>“’IS ’IGHNESS”</small></h2>


<p>At the sound of the closing door the boy in the chair
glanced up, laid aside his book, and pulled himself to his
feet. Despite his annoyance at what he considered the
other’s cheekiness in having taken possession of the study
without explanation or apology, Dick was forced to a
grudging admiration for the appearance of the boy who
confronted him. He was such a healthy, wholesome-looking
duffer, Dick thought, that it was a shame he hadn’t
better sense. What Dick saw across the length of the study
table was a broad-shouldered youth of sixteen years, attired
in a ludicrous red dressing-gown, much worn and faded,
which, despite the efforts of a knotted cord about the waist,
failed by several inches to envelop his form. His face was
somewhat square in contour, with a chin a trifle too heavy
for beauty, but, as Dick reflected, undoubtedly appropriate
to the rest of the features. The eyes were intensely blue
and the hair was neither brown nor straw-colored, but of
some indescribable shade between. The cheeks were full
of very healthy color. For the rest, the youth was of
medium height, sturdily built, and, save for an easy smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of unembarrassed greeting which annoyed Dick at the moment,
was decidedly prepossessing.</p>

<p>During the moment of silence that followed the closing
of the door, employed by Dick in a mental stock-taking
of his future roommate, the latter’s eyes were not idle.
He had been told that Richard Hope was the captain of
the crew, a position of honor which he reverenced as devoutly
as only an English lad can, and he was curious to
see what manner of boy filled that important office at
Hillton. He saw a tall youth, muscular rather than heavy,
with shoulders that filled out the coat almost to the bursting
point, and a fairly small head set well back. He saw
a face with clean-cut features; a straight, sensitive nose,
rounded and prominent chin, eyes rather far apart, and
high cheek-bones that gave a look of thinness to the face.
The eyes were brown, and the hair under the cloth cap
was of the same color. Above the nose were two distinct
short vertical lines, the result of a habit of drawing the
brows together into something approaching a frown when
anxious or puzzled. Just at present the lines were deep,
and the general expression of the face was one of ill-concealed
annoyance. It was the boy in the queer red dressing-gown
that first broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I fancy you’re Hope,” he said smilingly. “My name’s
Nesbitt, Trevor Nesbitt, upper middle; I’m to share your
quarters, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to know you,” answered Dick, without,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
however, much of delight in his tones. “I saw your
luggage in the room before supper, although, of course, I
didn’t know that it belonged to—er——”</p>

<p>“To the beggar that was so cheeky on the coach, eh?”
said Trevor. “I didn’t know it myself—that is, until I
went to the office. They told me before recess that they’d
put me in a room in Masters, but I didn’t know who I was
to be with. I——” He paused, with the slightest look
of embarrassment. “Fact is, I want to apologize for what
I said on the coach. I didn’t mean to be waxy, but those
bally gees pulled so like thunder—and I didn’t know who
you were, of course, and——”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” answered Dick. “I wouldn’t have interfered
only I thought you were going to upset us, and,
being a senior, it was my duty, you understand.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I see that,” responded Trevor earnestly.
“You were right to do what you did, and you ought to
have beat my silly head for me. You can now, you know,
if you like.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled, and then was sorry. He had meant to
maintain a lofty expression of hauteur, in order to impress
Trevor with the fact that while he was willing to
pass the other’s impertinence on the coach he could never
bring himself to an approval of a youth who so needlessly
endangered the lives of his companions in order to satisfy
a selfish whim, and who had so stubbornly transgressed the
Rules of the School (the latter suddenly appeared unusually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sacred to Dick, and he mentally spelled it with capital
letters). But the smile had, he feared, somewhat spoiled
his effort. He hastened to reassume his expression of calm
disapprobation, and asked:</p>

<p>“Did Professor Wheeler learn of it?” He had thrown
aside his coat and had seated himself before the hearth.
Trevor perched himself on an arm of the big chair and
smiled a trifle ruefully.</p>

<p>“Yes; I had a long talk with Wheels. I fancy he said
some very good things, but I was so beastly hungry that
I’m not certain. He told me to stay in the Yard for a
couple of weeks; rather nasty of him, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Well, Nesbitt, under the circumstances, of course——”
began Dick. Then he paused as he saw, or thought he saw,
a twinkle of amusement in the blue eyes before him.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, two weeks is soon over with, and I had lots
of fun while it lasted.” Trevor smiled reminiscently.</p>

<p>“You had driven before, I suppose?” asked Dick with
supreme indifference.</p>

<p>“Yes; the pater and I used to do a good bit that way
at home—in England, you know—and then last summer at
Richfield I kept a nag or two rather busy.”</p>

<p>“Have you been in this country long?” Dick really
didn’t care, of course, but one had to make conversation.</p>

<p>“Four years; the pater came over here to look after
his business and brought me with him; the manager died.
Then we thought—that is, the pater did—that he’d better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stay in New York and look after the American agency himself
for awhile. And we’ve been here ever since. Last
summer we decided that I’d better go to school somewhere.
The pater wanted me to go back to the other side
and enter Rugby, but I rather fancied staying over here;
so I found out about American schools, and when some one
told me that Hillton generally turned out the best eights
I decided to go there.” Dick displayed interest.</p>

<p>“Do you row?” he asked almost eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’ve rowed a little when I’ve had a chance, which
hasn’t been often. Americans don’t seem to do much that
way. When I was a little chap I was a good bit of a
wetbob, and was on the water a good deal. The pater
taught me all I know when I was about twelve; he rowed
stroke two years in the Cambridge boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll try for the crew,” answered Dick,
with kindly condescension. “We want all the candidates
we can get; and even if you don’t make the varsity boat
this spring, there’s the second; and you’d have a good show
for next year.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied Trevor calmly; “I’d made up my
mind to have a try for it. I rather fancy I’ll make the
varsity.”</p>

<p>Dick stared. Such confidence staggered him, and he
tried to detect amusement on the other’s countenance. But
his new roommate was staring seriously into the flames,
for all the world, Dick thought, as if he were trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>decide whether to accept the place at bow or stroke. Trevor
swung himself from the chair arm and tried to wrap
his dressing-gown closer about him.</p>

<p>“Well, I fancy I’d better get that luggage out of the
way. I didn’t want to unpack until you came and could
tell me where to put the things. I’ve got a few pictures
and some books, you know.”</p>

<p>“You can have either side of the study you want,” answered
Dick. “I was alone and so I stuck my things all
round. If you like I’ll take my stuff off that wall there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I say,” expostulated the other, “don’t do
that. You’ve got the den looking so jolly nice it would be
too bad to spoil it by taking anything down. I’ll just stick
one or two of my chromo things where there’s room. I
never was much at fixing up; my den always looks like
a bally stable.”</p>

<p>He passed into the bedroom and Dick heard him pulling
at knots and straps and between whiles whistling a lugubrious
tune that sounded all flats. Dick spread his feet
apart comfortably, thrust his hands into his pockets and
smiled at the fire; Nesbitt’s cock-suredness was truly delightful!
“He fancied he’d make the varsity!” Dick’s
grin enlarged and he chuckled softly. He almost wished
that it wasn’t necessary for him to dislike his new roommate;
there was something about the boy, possibly his
placid assurance, that appealed to him. But—and Dick’s
smile froze again—it wouldn’t do for him to even appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to countenance such escapades and—er—cheekiness as Nesbitt
had indulged in that afternoon. The youngster—he
was Dick’s junior by a year—must be taught that at Hillton
fun is one thing and——</p>

<p>Dick’s reverie was interrupted by the subject, who appeared
with a bunch of photographs in his hand.</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I put a couple of these on the mantel?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; it’s half yours, of course.”</p>

<p>The tone was very chilly, and Trevor’s cheeks flushed
slightly as he arranged the pictures behind the army of
mugs. He started away and then came back again, and,
taking a photograph from its place, looked hesitatingly at
Dick, who was apparently supremely indifferent to his
presence.</p>

<p>“That’s the pater,” he said finally, holding out the
card, and speaking a little wistfully. Dick took the picture.
It showed a middle-aged man, rather military looking,
in riding clothes; a fine, handsome chap, Dick thought,
and, having no quarrel with Trevor’s father, he said so:</p>

<p>“He’s awfully good-looking, Nesbitt.”</p>

<p>Trevor took the photograph and observed it a moment
with smiling eyes ere he placed it back on the mantel.
He was evidently monstrously proud of his father; but
he only replied with elaborate indifference:</p>

<p>“He’s rather a good sort, the pater.” He took the rest
of the pictures down and held them out. “Here’s some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
more if you care to see them.” Dick pretended to smother
a yawn. “Thanks,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m not boring you?” asked Trevor apologetically.</p>

<p>“No, indeed.” Dick was looking at the likeness of
an elderly woman in a high lace cap. “Not your mother,
is it?”</p>

<p>“No, that is my Aunt Grace; she lives in Manchester.
I haven’t a picture of the mater here; we have only one,
and the pater keeps that. She—she died when I was quite
a youngster.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dick softly. “I’m sorry. Mothers are—well,
I wouldn’t want to lose mine, Nesbitt.”</p>

<p>“I fancy not. We—the pater and I—were awfully cut
up when the mater died. That’s a cousin of mine; he’s at
Rugby.”</p>

<p>The picture showed a stolid-looking boy with decidedly
heavy features attired in flannels and leaning with studied
carelessness on a cricket bat. It was typically English,
Dick thought as he laid it aside. A photograph with
“Maud” scrawled across the bottom in high angular characters
showed a conscious-looking young lady of eighteen
or nineteen years simpering from a latticed doorway.
“That’s Cousin Maud,” explained Trevor; “she’s engaged
to a lieutenant of engineers in South Africa; she’s a jolly
nice girl.” When Dick had seen the last of the photographs
Trevor rearranged them on the mantel, and while
he was doing so there came a knock at the study door, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
by the entrance of a youth in a long ulster on which
the snowflakes were melting.</p>

<p>“Hello, Earle, come in!” cried Dick, arising and shaking
hands with the newcomer. “Where’s Carl?”</p>

<p>Stewart Earle, a slim, bright-faced boy of apparently
fourteen years of age, shook the flakes from his coat and
drew a note from his pocket.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t come over, Hope, so he asked me to bring
this to you. I had to come over to the library. It’s snowing
like all get out.”</p>

<p>Dick took the note and ran his eyes over it. The little
creases deepened on his forehead as he tossed it onto the
table. “Take off your coat, Earle, and sit down. By the
way, do you know Nesbitt?” And as the two shook hands,
“Nesbitt’s going to share these quarters with me.”</p>

<p>“Can’t stay,” answered Earle, “for I’ve got an hour’s
work looking up some silly stuff about some silly Grecian
war. You’re looking awfully fit, Hope.”</p>

<p>“So are you,” laughed Dick. “You don’t look at all
like the pasty-faced little junior of two years back.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like him, either,” answered Stewart with
a smile. “Shall I say anything to Carl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell him I’m awfully much obliged, and that I’ll
look him up to-morrow if I don’t meet him at recitation.
Good-night; sorry you won’t stay.”</p>

<p>When the door had closed again Dick took up the note
and reread it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Dick” (it ran), “Wheels has sent for me to go
over to his house this evening; something about the indoor
meeting. So I sha’n’t be able to see you to-night.
What I was going to tell you was that Taylor’s been trying
to raise trouble on the quiet with the crew fellows. He
says we can’t turn out a crew that will stand any show of
winning, and is trying to discourage the fellows. I’ll tell
you more when I see you to-morrow. Stewart’s going to
take this over to you.</p>

<p class="rightpad">“Yours in a hurry,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Carl</span>.</p>

<p>“P. S.—Somebody ought to punch Taylor’s head—hard.”</p></div>

<p>Dick smiled as he tore up the missive, and then
frowned. It was what he might have expected of Taylor,
he told himself, and yet it was a bit discouraging. However,
there was no use in meeting trouble half-way. He
got a book and settled himself to study. In the bedroom
Trevor was still distributing his belongings, and still whistling
his tuneless air. When bedtime came Dick was silent
and preoccupied, a fact which Trevor noticed.</p>

<p>“Hope you haven’t had bad news,” the latter said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Dick, “nothing to hurt.”</p>

<p>Trevor turned out the gas and climbed into bed.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” answered Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>For a long time the latter lay staring into the darkness
thinking of Carl Gray’s note, and of Roy Taylor, and of
Trevor Nesbitt; a good deal of Trevor. And the more
he thought, the less satisfied with himself he became. His
last thought as he turned over on his pillow and closed his
eyes was that he had behaved like a particularly disagreeable
prig.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>IN THE GYM</small></h2>


<p>Trevor left the dressing-room and climbed the stairs
to the running track. The gymnasium was quiet and filled
with the twilight of a winter afternoon. It was but a few
minutes after three, and, save for a youth who was heroically
exercising with the weights, the building appeared
deserted. But as he reached the head of the stairs the
soft pat of shoes on the boards greeted him, and he stepped
aside to let a lithe runner jog past. He recognized him
as Stewart Earle, the boy who had brought the message to
Dick Hope the night before, and when he next passed he
nodded.</p>

<p>“Hello,” answered Stewart as he slowed down a little,
“I didn’t recognize you. Awfully dark to-day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Beastly,” responded Trevor. Then, with a glance at
the big clock he started into a slow jog, lifting his feet
high and stretching his muscles, that were somewhat stiffened
by a week’s idleness. A flood of subdued white light
bathed the track from the big north window, and as he
passed he could hear the soft <em>swir</em> of the snowflakes against
the glass. It had been snowing all night and all day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
showed as yet no sign of abatement. The broad skylights
in the roof were covered deeply, and looked from beneath
like sheets of lead.</p>

<p>The boy at the weights stopped and disappeared into
the dressing-room. Perhaps he found it lonely work there
all by himself. The pat of the runners’ shoes alone broke
the stillness. Trevor took his pace from Stewart, and for
some time the two circled the track. It was twenty-four
laps to the mile, and when he had accomplished that
distance Trevor went down and put in several minutes with
the weights. Several other boys had entered meanwhile,
and were changing outdoor clothing for gymnasium suits.
When he had rubbed himself dry after a shower bath, Trevor
took a seat by Stewart and began to dress leisurely.</p>

<p>“Do you run much?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; that is, I try. I did a mile and a half to-day.
I’m going to try for the two hundred and twenty yards at
the indoor meet.”</p>

<p>“Why, so am I,” answered Trevor. Stewart grimaced.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s all up with me, then,” he said ruefully.
“They say you’re a dandy sprinter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not much. I suppose there are lots of entries,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Only about sixteen, I think. You’re one of the upper
middle relay team, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m to run last, I believe. I hope we beat the
seniors,” laughed Trevor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got more reason to want to win than
you,” responded Stewart. “My father and mother are
coming up for the meet. We live in Poughkeepsie, you
know; I’d like awfully to win that two-twenty, but I guess
I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think you need be afraid of me,” said
Trevor; “I feel rather rusty to-day. Fact is, you know,
I’m a bit too heavy on my legs for sprints, I fancy. I
think I’ll chuck it after Saturday night; I’m going to try
for the crew.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” said Stewart admiringly. “You look as
though you’d make a cracking good oar. I sometimes think
I’d like to try for the crew; perhaps I can year after next;
Beck doesn’t want me to now, he says.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t want you to? Do you mean he’s forbid
you?”</p>

<p>“N-no, he hasn’t forbidden me; but I always do as he
tells me. You see”—Stewart paused in the middle of a
struggle with a white sweater—“Beck’s done all sorts of
things for me. Why, when I came here a year ago last
fall I only weighed about eighty pounds; I was always
tired, and didn’t have any—any ambition for anything;
used to sit in my room and read. Of course there’s no
harm in reading, but I didn’t seem to do anything else;
Gray—I room with him over in the village—Gray used to
call me the ‘White Mouse.’ I guess I was a pretty poor-looking
youngster. Well, Professor Beck got hold of me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
one day and induced me to take up a course of training;
of course I’d been doing my two days a week here at the
weights and things, but I always shirked and got tired, and
it never did me any good, I guess. But Beck made me take
walks, wouldn’t let me eat anything but what was on a list
he gave me, and put me at weights. Finally he got me
to try jumping, and then running. I liked running right
away. First thing I knew I couldn’t get enough to eat, it
seemed; used to be hungry every meal. Then I entered the
four hundred and forty yards last winter at the indoor
meeting and came in second. After that I couldn’t run
enough. I won the four hundred and forty at the handicap
meet in the spring, and wanted to go to the Interscholastic
Meet, only Beck said I’d better wait until this
year. Of course I’m not a Samson yet, but I’m about
two hundred per cent better than I was a year or so ago.
And—and Beck did it. And that’s why I do what he
says.”</p>

<p>“I see,” answered Trevor. “Well, Beck knows his
business. You look about as fit as any chap I’ve seen here,
and I don’t blame you for giving under to him. By the
way, Gray’s the baseball captain, isn’t he? Rather tall, thin
chap?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s awfully smart, regular jack-of-all-trades.
He used to do stunts for the fellows, like mend golf clubs
and cricket bats, and mold golf balls and things, and
made pretty near enough money last year to pay his board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and room rent. But he got the Carmichael scholarship
last winter, and so he doesn’t do much of that sort this
term. This is his second year as captain of the nine, and I
guess he could be captain again if he was going to be here,
but he goes up to college next fall. He—he’s been a—he’s
been awfully kind to me—ever since I came here.” Stewart
glanced rather apologetically at Trevor, doubtful as to
whether he would feel a schoolboy’s contempt for the trace
of feeling that he had unintentionally allowed to creep
into his tones. But Trevor smiled understandingly.</p>

<p>“Must be a good sort,” he answered sympathetically.
“Hello, here’s Hope.”</p>

<p>Dick approached and nodded smilingly to the two. He
had a slip of paper in his hand, and as he greeted them
he glanced over the dressing-room as though in search of
some one.</p>

<p>“Have either of you fellows seen Professor Beck?”
Both replied in the negative, and Dick folded up the slip
and placed it in his pocket. “I’ve been looking all over the
place for him; wanted to see him about the crew candidates.
By the way, Nesbitt, we want you to report here a week
from Tuesday at four o’clock. I’m going to post the notices
this evening. Carl tells me you’re going to try for the two
hundred and twenty yards, Stewart?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m down for it, but Nesbitt here says he’s entered
too, and I’m rather doubtful of my chances now.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you ran,” said Dick, turning to Trevor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I run a bit, now and then. I’ve been jogging
round the track and feel as stiff as a poker.”</p>

<p>“That’ll wear off all right. I was stiff myself to-day—at
recitations.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” exclaimed Stewart. “I honestly
didn’t know a thing. I think they ought to give us a day
after recess to get caught up with things; a fellow can’t do
any studying the night he gets back to school. I went
to the library last night and almost fell asleep over an encyclopedia.”</p>

<p>“Well, you did better than I did. I scarcely looked
into a book.”</p>

<p>“Ditto,” said Trevor. “‘Turkey’ gave us fits; there
wasn’t a chap in the English class knew what the lesson
was.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to have a go at the weights,” said
Dick. “See you two later.”</p>

<p>“And I guess I’ll go back to the room,” said Stewart.
“If you haven’t anything better to do, Nesbitt, you might
walk over that way.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but Wheels is rather careful of my health
just now, and doesn’t want me to leave the grounds; he’s
afraid I might get my feet wet, I fancy; so I’ll come over
and see you some other time. I have half an idea to do
some studying, just to be queer.”</p>

<p>The two went out together, and Dick, opening his
locker, proceeded to attire himself in his gymnasium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
clothes. The room had filled up with boys, and he was
kept busy answering questions about the crew. A big
youth in a blue-and-white striped sweater entered, and,
seeing Dick, made for him at once.</p>

<p>“Say, Hope, is it so that we’re not going to have any
crew this spring?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not so. We’re going to have the best crew
that we ever put into the water,” answered Dick. “Who
told you such rot as that?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know who did say it, but I’ve heard one
or two fellows talking about it. I’m glad there’s no truth
in it, old chap; I didn’t think there was, you know. When
are we going to work?”</p>

<p>“Report a week from Tuesday at four, will you? I
guess we’ll start the trouble about the fifteenth. And say,
Crocker, if you hear any one talking nonsense about no
crew or poor material, just call them down, will you?
There’s nothing in it, and it’s hard enough anyhow to get
the fellows to turn out without any rumors of that
sort.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Crocker swung himself off, and Dick went into the gymnasium
and set to work at the weights. With the cords
over his shoulders and the irons sliding rhythmically in the
box, he began to go over in his mind a conversation he
had had a half hour before with Carl Gray. Carl’s information
had not been encouraging, and Dick was more worried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
than he liked to own even to himself. Carl had
stayed at the academy during the recess, as had Roy
Taylor—the first for financial reasons, the latter because
his home was half-way across the continent. According to
Carl, Taylor had been very active for a week past in predicting
a failure for the crew among the old men and the
possible candidates. He could have but one end in view,
to discourage the fellows, and render it difficult, if not
impossible, for Dick to get enough good men to form a
winning eight. The worst of it was, he reflected, that
Taylor’s manner of creating discouragement was so artful
that it was out of the question to charge him with it. Even
during his loudest talk about the uselessness of trying to
form a good crew, he never failed to announce his intention
of reporting for practice and of doing all in his power to
avert the impending defeat. And now, as evidenced by
Crocker’s remark a few minutes since, he had even managed
to gain circulation for the report that there was to be no
crew at all!</p>

<p>Dick changed his position, pulling the grips with half-arm
movement to his shoulders, and frowned wrathfully at
the wall. Carl was right, he told himself; Taylor deserved
to have his head punched! That, however, was the last
remedy to be considered, if only for the reason that to
lose Taylor from the boat meant almost certain defeat.
For the big Nebraskan was without any doubt the best man
at Number 7 that a Hillton crew had had for many years—strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a hard worker, and an excellent oar. Plainly the
last thing to do was to antagonize him. Besides, he was
popular among quite a lot of the fellows, and his word
undoubtedly had weight; another reason for making almost
any sacrifice to retain his good-will. If there was only another
man to take his place at Number 7, thought Dick,
tugging the cords viciously, he’d mighty soon spoil his
game, but—he ran quickly over the fellows who by any
possible stretch of the imagination might be considered
material for Taylor’s position in the boat, and sighed.
There was no one. It might be that there was one among
the newer candidates who, by dint of hard work, could be
fashioned into a good Number 7, but to lose Taylor for such
a possibility was risky work. No, the only course was to
apparently know nothing of Taylor’s underhand work, to
undo it as best he could, and to at all hazards keep him
in the crew. For a moment Dick wished that Taylor had
been made captain.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hope!”</p>

<p>Dick turned to find a big, good-looking youth of eighteen
with a rather florid complexion and black eyes and hair
smiling broadly upon him. He was dressed in knitted tights
and jersey that showed an almost perfect form, and swung
a pair of boxing-gloves in one hand.</p>

<p>“Hello, Taylor,” answered Dick, forcing himself to return
the smile. “How are you?”</p>

<p>“First-rate. Glad to see you back. Some one said you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
were in here, and I thought I’d look you up; wanted to ask
about crew practice. When are the fellows going to report?”</p>

<p>“Tuesday week.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll be on hand. Rather a tough outlook,
though, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; we’ve enough of last year’s fellows
to make a good basis for the new crew. I think we’ll do
pretty well.”</p>

<p>Taylor shook his head sadly, then looked up and smiled
brightly.</p>

<p>“Well, never say die, eh? We must all do our best.
You can count on me, you know, old fellow. In fact, I’ve
been drumming up trade already; persuaded quite a bunch
of chaps to report. The trouble is that they don’t seem to
think it’s worth while; seem to be cock-sure that we’ll be
beaten.”</p>

<p>“Do they? I haven’t heard anything of that sort.
There isn’t any good reason for it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Hope, you’ll have to own up we’ve got
a hard row to hoe. I wouldn’t say so to any one else, you
understand, but just between ourselves, I don’t think we’ve
got the ghost of a show.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Dick smilingly, “all the more reason
for hard work. And for goodness’ sake, don’t let the fellows
hear you talking that way.”</p>

<p>“Me? I guess not,” protested Taylor. “I know better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
than that, I hope! Well, I’m going to have a bout with
Miller; see you again.”</p>

<p>As the other turned and crossed the floor, Dick became
possessed of an almost overwhelming desire to follow
him and call him to account; to have it out with him then
and there, and, if necessary, to—to—— His fists clenched
themselves and he set his teeth together. He was glad when
Taylor passed from sight. Turning again to the weights
he seized the cords and for many minutes the irons bumped
and banged up and down in the slides as though—well,
as though some one thereabouts was hopping mad.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE INDOOR MEETING</small></h2>


<p>The gymnasium was brilliantly lighted, and the seats
that had been placed under the balconies were well filled,
for, despite the inclemency of the weather, the town folks
had turned out in force for the indoor meeting. The floor
had been cleared of standards and bars, while ropes, rings,
and trapezes had been relegated to the dim recesses of the
arching roof. A running track had been roped off on the
main floor, with inclined platforms at the corners of the
hall to aid the runners at the turns, while the regular track
above was turned into a temporary gallery from which the
fellows who were not going to compete—and there were
about a hundred and fifty of them—viewed the fun, leaning
far over the railing, laughing, shouting, and singing excitedly.
The four classes had gathered each to itself as far
as was possible; the seniors on the left, the upper middle
class on the right, the lower middle at one end of the hall
and the juniors at the other. In front of them long
draperies of class colors festooned the railing, and class challenged
class with cheers and songs, and the Hillton band
struggled bravely with a popular march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The trial heats in several of the events had already been
run off, and in the middle of the floor a number of contestants
were putting a canvas-covered twelve-pound shot
with varying success when Stewart Earle, accompanied by
Trevor Nesbitt, left the dressing-room, and pushing their
way through the narrow aisles between the rows of chairs,
at last reached the former’s father and mother, who, in
company with a tall and slender boy of sixteen, occupied
seats next to the improvised barrier that divided audience
from running track.</p>

<p>“I want you to know Trevor Nesbitt,” said Stewart.
“Nesbitt, my mother and father. And that little boy beyond
there is Master Carl Gray.” Trevor shook hands with
a small, middle-aged gentleman in sober black, who peered
upward at him in a manner that suggested near-sightedness,
and with a lady somewhat younger than her husband, whose
plain but kind face and sweet voice at once won his heart.
As Gray was quite beyond reach of his hand, he merely
accorded that youth a smiling nod. Stewart was still
talking.</p>

<p>“You remember, mother, I told you that Nesbitt was
going to run in the two hundred and twenty yards, don’t
you? Well, the funny part of it is that we ran a dead
heat in the first trial! I guess I’m a goner already.” He
ended with a smile that only partly concealed his uneasiness.</p>

<p>His mother smiled from him to Trevor.</p>

<p>“Then you two boys will run together?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” answered Trevor. “There’s five of
us left for the final.”</p>

<p>“That’s very nice,” she replied, “for if Stewart is
beaten he will not feel so badly if you are the winner, will
you, dear?”</p>

<p>Trevor muttered something about there being no danger
of his winning, while Stewart answered gaily: “But
you’re leaving the other three chaps out of the game,
mother; perhaps one of them will beat us both.”</p>

<p>“No fear,” said Carl Gray; “Dunlop’s a stiff, Wharton
isn’t in your class, Stew, and as for Milkam, well,
I think you can beat him out all right at a hop; so
it’s between you and Nesbitt, and may the best man
win.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Mr. Earle, nodding his head approvingly.
“If your friend is a better runner than you, Stewart,
he should win, of course. When do you race?” He
held a program up to his eyes and scowled in an endeavor
to decipher the lines.</p>

<p>“In about twenty minutes, I guess. Let me see,
father.” Stewart took the program. “‘Twenty-yard dash,
junior; twenty-yard dash, senior; putting twelve-pound
shot; running high jump; one-mile run; pole vault; sixty-yard
hurdle; eight-hundred-and-eighty-yard run; two-hundred-and-twenty-yard
dash; relay race, one mile, lower middle
class versus junior class; relay race, one mile, senior
class versus upper middle class.’ Well, you can’t tell by this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
I guess; they’ll just pull off the events when they feel
like it.”</p>

<p>“All out for the eight hundred and eighty yards,” cried
a voice across the building.</p>

<p>“There, see?” said Stewart. “That event’s down after
the hurdles; you can’t tell much by the program; you
never can. I wish they’d call the two hundred and twenty
now, though.”</p>

<p>“Getting nervous, Stew?” asked Carl Gray.</p>

<p>“A little, I guess. There they come for the half mile.
Look, there’s Keeler of our class; he’s one of our relay
team; isn’t he a peach?”</p>

<p>“A what, dear?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“A—er—well, I mean isn’t he fine?” stammered Stewart,
while Carl and Trevor exchanged grins.</p>

<p>“Is he? He looks from here dreadfully thin,” answered
Mrs. Earle.</p>

<p>“That’s partly what makes him a good runner,” explained
Stewart. “He’s all muscle, scarcely any weight to
carry.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, I do hope you won’t get to looking like
that.”</p>

<p>“Humph, I should hope not.” This from Stewart’s
father. The bunch of ten runners had left the mark, and
had begun their long series of tours about the track,
cheered from the gallery by their fellows. “Go it, Keeler!”
shouted Stewart as a youth with ludicrously long legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ambled past, almost the last of the group. A quick
glance and a fleeting grin from a queer, good-humored, and
very freckled face answered Stewart’s cry, and the runners
swept by, their feet pounding loudly as they took the inclines
at the turns. The shot putting was over and the victor,
a dumpy-looking boy with the lower middle class colors
across his shirt, had been clamorously hailed as he walked
off with superb dignity, and the vaulting standards were
being put in place while a group of half a dozen youths
trod gingerly about looking very serious and important.
Finally the bar was up, with a white handkerchief across
it, and one after another of the contestants, with the long
pole in their hands, ran lightly forward, rose till their white-clad
bodies swung out from the staff like pennants, and
dropped across the bar.</p>

<p>“Why, how easily they do it!” cried Mrs. Earle admiringly,
and Stewart’s father clapped his hands vigorously.</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Stewart, “that’s nothing; they haven’t
begun yet; just wait until they get that bar up to about
nine feet.”</p>

<p>“Nine feet! Why, how high is it now, dear?”</p>

<p>“’Bout seven foot eight, I should think; eh, Carl?”</p>

<p>“There it goes to the even eight,” answered Carl, as the
judges raised the bar.</p>

<p>“Is—is there any danger of their falling, Carl,” asked
Mrs. Earle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a bit, and if they do they’ll hit the mattress. I
say, Stew, look at Keeler.”</p>

<p>The runners had completed half the distance, and as
they again swept by the freckled-faced and long-legged
lower middle class boy left his place near the rear of the
procession, and with an easy spurt placed himself in the
first group. The three boys added their applause to that
which thundered down from the far end of the gallery.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if he won,” said Trevor.
“He’s running easy and has lots more spurt left, to look
at him. But, of course, Manning is a pretty tough proposition,
I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Manning isn’t what he cracks himself up to be,” said
Carl decidedly. “And I’ll just bet you that Keeler wins
out easily.”</p>

<p>A bell clanged warningly, and the tumult in the gallery
increased. “Last lap, fellows! Last lap!” “Go it,
Freckles!” “Brace up, Manning! Come on, come on!”
But Manning couldn’t “come on” to any great extent, and
the lower middle boys, leaning perilously over the edge
of the gallery, fluttered their colors frantically and shouted
incoherent advice, entreaty, and triumph as Keeler, his
long legs working like a well-lubricated machine, his
freckled face overspread with an easy and confident smile,
swept superbly by the exhausted Manning and two other
runners and crossed the line, as Carl had predicted, an easy
winner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>When the tumult had subsided to some extent the trial
heats in the senior twenty-yard dash were begun, the track
being diagonally across the floor, and bunch after bunch of
white-clad youths raced like the wind toward the tape.
The pole vaulting came to an end with a record-breaking
accomplishment of nine feet two inches by a member of
the upper middle class, and the running high jump began.
Then, “All out for the two-twenty, and hurry up!” came
the command from somewhere, and Stewart and Trevor
struggled through the throng toward the dressing-room to
throw aside their wraps.</p>

<p>A minute or two later five boys stood on their marks
awaiting the report of the starter’s pistol. Trevor found
himself by the side of Dunlop; then came Stewart, Milkam,
and Wharton. There was a golden haze of floating dust in
the air, and the faces of Stewart’s father and mother and
of Carl Gray were indistinct across the building.</p>

<p>“Ready!”</p>

<p>“Get set!”</p>

<p>There was an intense silence about the starting-line, but
from above came a deep sound of lowered voices, subdued
laughter and the tramping of restless, excited feet.</p>

<p>“<em>Bang!</em>”</p>

<p>And ere the report had wholly died away the five runners
were a quarter-way about the track on the first of the
three laps constituting the two hundred and twenty yards.</p>

<p>As they passed under the left side of the gallery the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
seniors leaned over in an endeavor to catch sight of them
and urged their two heroes, Wharton and Milkam, with
eager cries. Then the turn was made, and Trevor, glancing
upward fleetingly, saw a long row of faces peering down
with open mouths from which came shouts of “Nesbitt!
Nesbitt!” “Dunlop! Dunlop!” A long banner of upper
middle class colors writhed serpent-like above him, and then
he was under the gallery, running swiftly. Now and then
he caught a blare of a merry two-step from the hard-worked
band. He glanced aside. Stewart was even with him, his
face anxious and somewhat pale. Wharton, Milkam, and
Dunlop were strung out behind, but all well in the race.</p>

<p>Up in the gallery, on the left, sat Dick Hope among the
seniors. Beside him were Williams and a stout, red-faced
youth whose real name was Todd, but who was more generally
known as “Toad.” Dick watched the runners circle
the end of the building.</p>

<p>“First lap’s done,” he said. “That roommate of mine,
Nesbitt, seems to be something of a runner.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Todd, “’Is ’Ighness is all right, if
he <em>is</em> a bloody Englishman.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be English than Dutch, Toad,” grinned
Williams.</p>

<p>“Shut up, you; I’m no more Dutch than you are.
Here they come! <em>Brace up, Wharton!</em>” and Todd leaned
over the railing and waved his cap wildly in air.</p>

<p>“You might as well save your breath, I guess,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Dick. “Wharton’s out of it, and so’s Milkam. The race’s
between Nesbitt and young Earle. And as we can’t win
it, I hope Earle will. He’s a decent, plucky youngster;
and—well, anything to beat upper middle, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’re not very loyal to your chum,” grinned Williams.</p>

<p>“He has no business being in the upper middle,” responded
Dick calmly. “By Jove, look there!”</p>

<p>Across the gymnasium the runners were speeding down
the back-stretch, Trevor and Stewart, side by side, leaving
the other three farther and farther behind at every step.
Wharton and Milkam were practically out of it; Dunlop
was ten yards to the bad, but running strongly and apparently
still capable of retrieving his lost ground. At the
turn Trevor hugged the inside of the track and Stewart,
smaller, lither, and speedier-looking, snuggled in close behind
him. Dunlop, head back, a look of grim determination
on his face, spurted until he had gained a position but
a scant two yards behind Stewart.</p>

<p>“Good boy, Dunlop!” shouted Williams, while from
across the building came a wild cry of joy from dozens of
throats.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s his last spurt,” muttered Dick; “he’s
showing the pace.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. The bell rang warningly, and the
shouting from excited partisans increased in volume as
<a href="#image03">the last lap</a> commenced. Trevor, still ahead, increased his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
speed. Stewart accepted the challenge promptly, and Dunlop,
after a brave but futile effort to keep his place, was
left behind. Milkam and Wharton plodded along easily
a full half lap in the rear until the latter, spying Dunlop’s
predicament, suddenly spurted, and entered the lists
with him in a contest for third place, leaving Milkam, bewildered,
hopelessly last.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<a name="image03" id="image03">
  <img src="images/image03.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_50">On the last lap.</a></div>
</div>

<p>At the second turn Trevor had given place to Stewart.
When the two entered the back-stretch Trevor drew alongside
his rival again, stayed there for an instant, and then
drew ahead. The gymnasium was a babel of voices. The
last lap was half run, and Trevor had put two yards of track
between him and Stewart. Many yards behind Dunlop and
Wharton were having a hot race of their own wholly unnoticed,
for every eye followed the two youths whose flying
feet were now pounding the incline at the third corner.</p>

<p>“’Is ’Ighness wins easily,” said Todd, shouting to make
himself heard above the shrieks of his neighbors. Dick
nodded. He was sorry to see Stewart beaten, but surprised
to find himself suddenly experiencing a sensation of pride in
the work of his roommate. After all, he had run a great
race and deserved to win; and really, when he came to think
about it, Nesbitt was handicapped by greater weight,
and——</p>

<p>“Earle’s closing up!” cried Williams.</p>

<p>And so it was. With the contest almost over, the
younger boy had forged ahead, and at the last turn secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the inside of the track. Trevor was wobbling! Twice he
swerved unsteadily, but as the home-stretch was reached
appeared to pull himself together with an effort, and gallantly
strove to pass Stewart. But the latter, running
steadily and seemingly untired, not only held his own, but
tacked another two yards onto his gain and breasted the
tape an easy winner! And how lower middle did yell!</p>

<p>Dunlop and Wharton fought it out to the end side by
side, the former securing third place by the smallest of
margins.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that!” exclaimed Williams
in deep disgust as soon as he could make himself
heard. “Why, ’Is ’Ighness had the race in his pocket!”</p>

<p>“I think——” Dick hesitated.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” Dick smiled.</p>

<p>“I think Nesbitt was beaten,” he answered.</p>

<p>Williams viewed him in painful disgust.</p>

<p>“I think you’re nutty,” he growled. “Don’t you suppose
I can see when a man’s beaten?”</p>

<p>“Not always, I guess,” replied Dick enigmatically.</p>

<p>Whereupon Williams begged Todd to bathe Dick’s
head, and in the fracas that followed the amazing result of
the two-hundred-and-twenty-yard dash was for the time
forgotten.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE RELAY RACE</small></h2>


<p>That evening was destined to be one of triumph for
Stewart Earle and the lower middle class. In the relay
race that followed the two-hundred-and-twenty-yard dash
the juniors had never a chance from first to last, and lower
middle’s fourth man cantered home almost in time to tag
the junior’s last runner ere he left the mark. Stewart and
Trevor viewed the contest squatting on the floor beside
the seats occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Earle and Carl Gray.</p>

<p>Stewart’s mother had welcomed victor and vanquished
with impartial favor, although her pride and pleasure in
her boy’s success was patent to all. Stewart’s father smiled
near-sightedly at Trevor, and assured him that he had made
a remarkable race, but his words didn’t disguise for a moment
the fact that he had expected Stewart to win, and
that he was somewhat surprised at Trevor’s thinking for
a moment that he (Trevor) stood any chance of victory.
Even Stewart appeared uncomfortable at his father’s tone,
and strove to change the subject lest Trevor should feel
hurt. But the latter was genuinely glad that Stewart’s
parents had witnessed a victory for their son and had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a thought of disappointment or envy. As to the reason
for his sudden and unexpected giving-out, however, Trevor
had little to say, and when Carl suggested that perhaps he
had insufficient training since the recess he eagerly acknowledged
that that might have had something to do with it.</p>

<p>“But I never had a hope of winning,” Stewart had
cried, “after the second round! I just kept on going because—well,
you know—just to make as good a showing
as I could. When you fell behind I was so surprised that
I almost stopped.”</p>

<p>The sixty-yard hurdle-race proved of exciting interest
to Mr. and Mrs. Earle, and every one else, for that matter,
and was won in the closest kind of a finish by a senior class
fellow in the remarkably good time of eight seconds. The
one-mile run followed, but failed to awaken much enthusiasm
from the audience, who were impatient for the final
event, the senior-upper middle relay race. When the mile
run was half over Trevor shook hands with Mr. and Mrs.
Earle, and, encouraged by their hearty wishes for his success,
hurried off to the dressing-room. Kernan, captain of
the upper middle team, took him aside and questioned him
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re not very fit, Nesbitt. I was going
to run you last, but I guess I’ll let Chalmers have the
final and put you second. How do you feel?”</p>

<p>“Spiffin!” answered Trevor heartily, “never felt better.
Don’t get it into your noddle that I’m done up, old chap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and don’t change the order on account of that two-twenty
dash. That was judgment more than anything else——”</p>

<p>“Judgment!” ejaculated Kernan. “I didn’t see much
judgment in it!”</p>

<p>“That’s your stupidity, Kernan. Can’t stop to explain
now; but just you go ahead and let me run last, like a good
fellow, and I promise you you won’t regret it.” Kernan
frowned hesitatingly; then his face cleared and he slapped
Trevor on the back.</p>

<p>“All right, Nesbitt; run last you shall. I don’t pretend
to understand that two-twenty, but I’ll trust you to do your
work. We’ve got a stiff race, I guess, but we’re not beaten
yet. The seniors will put Taylor last, I expect; he’s a good
man, all right, but if we can hold onto them until the
last round I think you can down him. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say you give me a fairly even start with Roy Taylor,
and I’ll beat him out!” answered Trevor doggedly.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! Of course, I can’t promise the even
start, but I’ll do my best, Nesbitt; and you’ll do yours, I
know, and——”</p>

<p>“Ready for the relay! All out, fellows!”</p>

<p>Trevor, Kernan, and the other two members of their
team, Chalmers and Johnston, hurried to the starting-line,
followed by four very proper-looking boys wearing the
senior colors. The band, hidden from sight by a fringe of
shouting juniors at the end of the gallery, played for all
it was worth. The seniors and upper middle fellows were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
cheering the members of their teams individually and collectively,
and the uproar was tremendous.</p>

<p>Professor Beck, athletic director, and at present that
court of last appeal, the referee, gave the instructions in
quick, clear tones as the first two contestants stood on their
marks. The professor was a short man who wore glasses,
who always dressed faultlessly, whether for a principal’s
reception or an afternoon on the campus, whose slightest
turn of the head or crook of the finger bespoke authority,
and whose voice, ordinarily low but incisive, could swell
into a very fair imitation of a speaking-trumpet on short
notice. For the rest, he understood boy nature from A
to Z, and beyond, and could turn a good track athlete out
of anything except a wooden post, given the opportunity.
Hillton fellows, when graduated from the narrow prejudices
of the junior year, worshiped two local deities—Professor
Wheeler, the principal, and Professor Beck; and
there was a well-defined notion prevalent that should some
beneficent Fate remove from the academy all the rest of
the faculty things would not only continue undisturbed, but
would run better than ever.</p>

<p>I have dealt at some length on Professor Beck because
he is a person of much importance. When he dies—may
the day be far!—his portrait will hang beside those of the
founder and past principals in the chapel, to be outwardly
guyed and inwardly reverenced by succeeding generations
of loyal Hilltonians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, get them off quickly,” commanded the professor.
The starter cried his perfunctory “On your marks!
Get set!” and then the little pistol barked with all the
ferocity of a toy spaniel, and the great event of the meeting,
the senior-upper middle one-mile relay race, was on.</p>

<p>Johnston, for the upper middle, and a youth named Cummings,
for the seniors, shot off together, and began their
quarter mile as though they had but one lap to accomplish
instead of six. The pace was too good to last, and every one
knew it, including the runners, and so, when they had made
the first round of the track, they slowed down as though
by mutual consent, and went at the contest in businesslike
style. Seniors and upper middle classmen cheered their
respective candidates, and hurled taunts across the hall.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The U. M. is a stupid pup<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who laps his milk from out a cup;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He may have sense when he grows up<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And gets to be a Senior!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this chanted aspersion the upper middle fellows replied
with howls of derision, and started upon their own
poetic catalogue of the deficiencies of the rival class, the
first verse of which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Said the Prof. unto the Senior:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">‘You must alter your demeanor,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For such ways I’ve never seen; you’re<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Quite as awkward as a hen;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your walk is most unsightly, sir;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pray place your feet more lightly, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And always bow politely, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">To the Upper Middle men!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>There were five more verses to it, and while it lasted
the seniors, led by Dick and Todd, could only cheer incessantly
and stamp their feet in a hopeless endeavor to drown
the song.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the first quarter of the race was nearly over,
and Johnston and Cummings, the former leading by a scant
ten yards, were spurting along the back-stretch. Then the
senior runner reached the line, touched hands with the next
man, and dropped from the track tired and breathless just
as Cummings came up and Chalmers took his place in the
race.</p>

<p>As Johnston crossed the line Dick slipped his watch
back into his pocket. “Fifty-seven and four fifths seconds!”
he bawled into Williams’s ear. “Johnston ought to have
done better by three fifths.”</p>

<p>Williams nodded. “We’ve got the start of them, however,”
he answered.</p>

<p>On the second lap Clark, the senior runner, increased
the lead to a good fifteen yards, and from there on to the
finish, Chalmers, try as he might and did, could not close
the gap, and the second quarter was finished in the good
time of fifty-seven and one fifth seconds. Kernan, the
upper middle team captain, entered the race with set, determined
face, and ere the first lap of the third quarter had
been reeled off had raised the flagging hopes of his classmates
by a wonderful burst of speed that put him on equal
terms with the senior runner, Morris. At the third corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he secured the inside of the track, and kept it during the
whole of the second, third, and fourth laps, although Morris
tried hard to reach him.</p>

<p>The shouting from the upper middle seats was wild
and continuous, and the swirling banners waved riotously
over Kernan as, with head back and bare legs twinkling,
he sped along, every instant now lengthening the space between
him and the pursuer. And then suddenly the cheers
and shouts of acclaim were changed to cries of alarm and
dismay. There was the sound of a fall, and a white-clad
form plunged to the floor and rolled over and over. Kernan
at the third corner had tripped on the incline.</p>

<p>Morris, racing along but a few yards behind, leaped
over the rolling body, stumbled, recovered himself after a
few strides, and went on. Half a dozen fellows hurried
toward Kernan, but he was on his feet again before they
could reach him, and, although he was plainly bruised and
sore from his fall, took up the running pluckily, amid
cheers. But his task was a hopeless one. Morris had used
the misadventure to good purpose, and now between him and
the upper middle captain a third of a lap stretched. Kernan,
with white face, tried desperately to make up the lost
ground, and even succeeded in doing so to some extent, but
Morris’s lead was too great, and that youth swept breathlessly
over the line, nearly a quarter of a lap to the good,
and, touching the impatient, outstretched fingers of Roy
Taylor, sank exhausted to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Trevor, poised for a quick start, heard Taylor’s feet resounding
over the first incline as Kernan, staggering by,
touched his hand for a fleeting instant and toppled over.
With a dash Trevor took up the running. A quarter of a
lap was more than he had bargained for when he had professed
his ability to beat Roy Taylor, but he was not discouraged.
He knew Taylor well; knew that that youth was
a fast and steady runner at quarter- and half-mile distances,
but knew also that, while a spurt at the finish was quite
within Taylor’s powers, a series of fast dashes had the effect
of worrying and exciting him. Trevor laid his plans accordingly.
He realized intuitively that he was in better condition
than his rival for hard and fast work; he had run in
the two-hundred-and-twenty-yard event, while Taylor had
not been on the track before that evening; a fact which, in
Trevor’s present good physical shape, worked to his advantage;
his former race, despite his defeat, had served to put
him into excellent condition for this one. He ran easily,
maintaining the distance between Taylor and himself, and
at the commencement of the second of the six laps constituting
the last quarter of the race he was still a quarter of a
lap behind.</p>

<p>“That’s good work, Nesbitt,” cried Kernan, who,
sprawled out on a mattress, was at last beginning to find
his breath once more. The band was almost vainly striving
to make its brazen notes heard above the shouting of the
students, while pennants of class colors writhed serpent-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in the air, and seniors and upper middle classmen hurled
defiant cheers at each other across the intervening space.
The lower middle boys and the juniors cheered indiscriminately,
although there was a tendency among the latter
class to uphold the seniors. Dick, Williams, Todd, and their
companions leaned over the railing and watched the contest
excitedly. Trevor and Taylor had begun the second lap, the
former with eyes intent upon the youth ahead, the latter
running with a great show of style, and with an easy and
confident smile upon his face.</p>

<p>“Taylor runs just as he does everything,” grumbled
Todd, “with one eye on the gallery.”</p>

<p>“He does like to show off,” assented Williams.
“Hello!”</p>

<p>A roar went up from floor and balcony, and Roy Taylor,
just mounting the second incline, turned his head to
see Trevor coming up on him like a whirlwind. Instantly
he leaped away, and the seniors, for a moment dismayed,
gave voice to their relief and approval. Trevor settled
down into his former pace, well satisfied, for by that unexpected
spurt he had taken off nearly a half of the distance
that had separated him from his opponent. Taylor, as soon
as he saw the danger over, settled back into his former
even but not extraordinary pace, and finished the second
lap running well within himself. The third lap began with
more encouraging prospects for the upper middle class.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>TREVOR’S VICTORY</small></h2>


<p>“I don’t like Taylor’s letting ’Is ’Ighness creep up on
him that way,” objected Williams. “He was napping; and
he’ll need every foot he can get before the race is over.”</p>

<p>“Nesbitt’s doing some head-work,” answered Dick, with
a note of admiration in his voice, “and I wouldn’t be surprised
to see him get the best of Taylor yet. If he can
keep up—— Look there!”</p>

<p>Trevor was at his former tactics. Just as Taylor
reached the second corner the upper middle boy fairly
threw himself forward, and ere the senior runner had taken
alarm had closed up with him until a mere six yards intervened.
The upper middle fellows howled with delight,
and the seniors, striving to hide their dismay, cheered lustily.
Taylor’s face wore a scowl as he increased his speed
and strove to regain his lost lead.</p>

<p>But Trevor held what he had taken, took his pace from
Taylor, and with never a look to right or left, kept doggedly
at the other’s heels. The fourth lap started in a
veritable pandemonium. Taylor was now but a scant ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
yards in the lead, and those who saw Trevor’s calm, intent
gaze fastened upon the other boy’s shoulders realized that,
barring a mishap such as had fallen to the lot of Kernan,
he would, if he did not actually win, at least finish so close
behind Taylor as to make the race one of the closest ever
witnessed at Hillton, indoors or out.</p>

<p>This time Taylor was on the lookout, and when Trevor
spurted was ready for him and so held his advantage. Trevor
was well satisfied, for he had no wish to pass Taylor
at that time, but only to tire and worry him. His spurt
lasted until the line was again crossed. And now Taylor
took the initiative and increased his speed, for, as Trevor
had expected, the short spurts had made him nervous. But
shake off his pursuer he could not, and with the lap half
run but five yards lay between the two.</p>

<p>“He’s a silly chump!” shouted Todd angrily, glaring
across at the speeding senior runner. “Why doesn’t he
keep that for the last lap; can’t he see he’s begun to spurt
too early?”</p>

<p>“I have an idea that Trevor Nesbitt’s got him scared,”
answered Dick.</p>

<p>“You just bet he has; he’s worried to death!” This
from Williams, who was scowling blackly. “He deserves
to lose it.”</p>

<p>“And Nesbitt deserves to win it,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Humph! You seem to have changed your tune!”</p>

<p>Dick accepted the gibe good-naturedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have; I think Nesbitt’s the headiest youngster I’ve
seen in a long while, and as for Taylor——”</p>

<p>The bell clanged loudly, announcing the beginning of
the last lap, and every fellow in the balcony was on his
feet in the instant. As he took the first turn Taylor glanced
hurriedly back and met the unwavering and, as it seemed
to him, relentless stare of Trevor, and putting every effort
into his work again increased his pace. Everybody was
shouting now, but as the two runners passed under the
seniors’ balcony one voice sounded more loudly than all:</p>

<p>“Good work, Nesbitt!”</p>

<p>And Trevor heard it and recognized Dick Hope’s voice,
and for an instant a smile crossed his face. Then the second
incline was under his feet, and he had to use care lest he
trip. But he got safely over, and now the time for his
final effort had come. Into the back-stretch he sped, and
the watchers held their breath, for foot by foot the lost
ground was being eaten up by his flying feet. Then a burst
of applause shook the rafters and Taylor, running despairingly,
heard the other lad’s feet at his side, strove to goad
his wearied limbs into faster strides, and found with dismay
at his heart that he had reached his limit.</p>

<p>At the third corner Trevor with a final effort leaped
into the lead, hugging the inside of the track. At the last
corner he was a yard to the good, and from there down
to the finish line, where Kernan and Chalmers and Johnston
leaped frantically about the floor, he held his vantage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
so toppled over into eager, outspread arms, aching, breathless,
and weak, but winner of the race. And as he stretched
himself gratefully on the mattress he heard the timekeeper
announce:</p>

<p>“Last quarter, fifty-seven and one fifth; the mile, three
forty-eight and two fifths.”</p>

<p>When Trevor reached his room he found Dick seated in
front of the fire, a Latin text-book face downward in his
lap, his arms over his head, and his eyes closed. The fire
was almost out, and the room was chilly. Trevor as silently
as possible placed another log in the grate, and, disappearing
into the bedroom, came out again with his dressing-gown,
which after a moment’s hesitation he spread over
the sleeper’s knees. Then he doffed his coat and cap, and
standing by the fireplace held his chilled hands to the blaze
and looked down at Dick. And as he looked he fell to
wondering why it was that he and his roommate got on
together so badly. It was not <em>his</em> fault, he told himself;
he had tried every way he knew to thaw Dick’s indifference.
It was now ten days since the winter term had commenced,
and the two boys were as much strangers to each
other as they had been after Trevor’s burst of confidence on
their first night together. Trevor often regretted that confidence;
he sometimes thought that he had bored Dick with
his family photographs and history, and remembered with
a flush that his roommate had never responded in like
manner. Of course, his cheekiness on the stage-coach during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that unfortunate drive had been the primary cause of
Dick’s dislike; and Trevor couldn’t blame the latter for taking
umbrage; only—well, he had apologized and explained,
and it seemed that the other ought to be willing to forgive.
It was not that Dick was nasty; he treated Trevor with
good-humored politeness; fact was, Trevor reflected dubiously,
Dick was altogether too polite; his politeness was
of the sort which he imagined a judge might display toward
the prisoner in the dock. He wished that Dick would throw
a boot at him so that they could have it out and come to an
understanding.</p>

<p>Dick moved restlessly and opened his eyes. His gaze
encountered Trevor’s and he smiled sleepily and stretched
himself. Then he sat up and looked about him perplexedly.</p>

<p>“Well, if I didn’t go to sleep!” he said. “What time
is it?”</p>

<p>Trevor glanced at the battered alarm-clock on the table.
“Ten minutes of twelve,” he answered.</p>

<p>Dick yawned and suddenly spied the dressing-gown. He
pulled it toward him and looked at it in astonishment.</p>

<p>“What——?”</p>

<p>Trevor flushed as he answered hurriedly: “It was so
bally chilly here when I came in, you know; and I thought
that maybe you’d catch cold. So I threw that over you.
Just pitch it on the floor there.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Dick. “I expect it was chilly. I was
going to put another stick on the fire, and while I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thinking about it I suppose I fell asleep. It’s pretty late,
isn’t it? Well, to-morrow’s Sunday.”</p>

<p>He arose and the two began to prepare for bed. There
was something in Dick’s tone and manner quite friendly, and
Trevor was puzzled.</p>

<p>“That was a great race you ran, Nesbitt,” said the
former presently.</p>

<p>“The last one wasn’t so bad,” answered Trevor.</p>

<p>“Bad! It was fine!” replied Dick warmly. “It was
the best bit of head-work I’ve seen on a track. And I was
glad you beat Taylor, even if it did mean the loss of the
race to the seniors. But I rather think I liked the first
race better.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course you would,” said Trevor. “Earle’s a
friend of yours; and he ran a good race. I—I didn’t much
mind his beating; he seems like a jolly good sort of a chap.”</p>

<p>“He is a good chap; and I know it pleased him like anything
to win that race, because his father and mother were
there, you see.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It would have been too bad if he’d lost it, wouldn’t
it?” Dick was smiling rather queerly, Trevor thought.</p>

<p>“I suppose it would,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Yes; and so you gave it to him.”</p>

<p>“What—what do you mean?” stammered Trevor, very
red and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Why,” laughed Dick, “just what I said. You’re not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
going to deny that you slowed down and let him win, are
you?”</p>

<p>For a long moment Trevor was very busy with his
nightshirt, which suddenly exhibited an unwonted dislike
to going on. Then:</p>

<p>“I fancy there’s no use denying it,” he muttered from
the folds of the mutinous garment.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” answered Dick smilingly.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Trevor presently, “Earle had set
his heart on winning, and it didn’t mean anything to me,
you know; I hadn’t any relatives looking on; and then his
mother was so—so jolly nice about it, and his father, and—and
all, that I just thought he might as well win. Doesn’t
it—don’t you think it was all right?”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t exactly fair, you know; but I guess it
was something even better,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“Do you think Earle suspected anything?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know; I didn’t see him. But Williams
and Todd, who were sitting with me, thought it was a
straight race, and so I guess Earle thought so too.”</p>

<p>Later, when the lights were out and the two were in
bed, Dick broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Are you awake, Nesbitt?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the reply from across the darkness.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking I’d take a good, long walk to-morrow
after church; up the river toward Port Wallace.
Like to go along?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say so!” was the hearty reply.</p>

<p>“All right, I wish you would. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” answered Trevor. Then, as he burrowed
his head contentedly in the pillow, he thought:
“I fancy it’s all right now, and he won’t have to throw
that boot after all!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>CANDIDATES FOR THE CREW</small></h2>


<p>Roy Taylor’s work was apparent when on the following
Tuesday afternoon the candidates for the crew reported
in the rowing-room at the gymnasium. Dick counted the
assemblage over twice, but could make no more than nineteen,
a sorry showing compared with last year; twenty men—including
himself—from which to select two eights! But
he was careful to let none of the discontent that he felt
appear on his face.</p>

<p>“There aren’t very many of us, fellows,” he said cheerfully,
“but I guess we all mean business, and that’s a good
deal.”</p>

<p>Professor Beck entered at that moment, paused to remove
his rubbers, and then surveyed the candidates through
his glasses.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, are you all here?” His gaze traveled
around the room. “But I see that you’re not. Four
o’clock was the hour, wasn’t it, Hope?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and it’s now a quarter after. I guess they’re
all here that are coming.”</p>

<p>“Bless me, this won’t do! How many—four, six, ten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sixteen, twenty? Twenty men for two crews. What do
you fellows think we’re going to race with this year, pair-oars?”</p>

<p>The candidates, perched about the room on window-sills
and radiators, smiled, but were careful not to laugh aloud,
since it was evident that the professor was thoroughly
vexed.</p>

<p>“Hope, you’ll have to go among the fellows and work
up some interest in the crews; and Taylor, you’re an old-crew
man, you do the same; and the rest of you, too, I want
you all to talk rowing, and next week I want as many more
candidates on hand. This is perfect poppycock! Twenty
men, indeed! Well, that’s all I’ve got to say to you;
now listen to Captain Hope.” And the professor withdrew
to a window, where he polished his glasses vigorously
and made a number of the new candidates very nervous
by the critical way in which he studied them.</p>

<p>“I’d like every fellow’s name before he leaves,” said
Dick. “And I want to see every one here promptly at
three o’clock next Wednesday afternoon. Meanwhile those
of you who haven’t been examined for crew work will
please attend to it. Have you set any special days, professor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow and Saturday afternoons,” answered
the latter, “between four and six.”</p>

<p>“You new fellows must understand that permits to take
part in baseball and track games won’t answer for rowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
so please see Mr. Beck to-morrow if possible; if not, on
Saturday. I hope that you’ll do as Mr. Beck has requested;
I mean try and work up more of an interest in
rowing; every fellow ought to be able to bring at least
one other fellow with him next Wednesday. We’ve got
a hard proposition before us this spring, but it’s by no
means a hopeless one. We’ve beaten St. Eustace on the
river before—often—and we can do it again; but it means
lots of hard work, and any fellow that’s afraid of work
might as well pull out now, for we can’t have any shirking.
Last spring there was a good deal of trouble at the
first of the season because the candidates—some of them,
that is—tried to get out of preliminary work. That won’t
do; the work on the weights at the beginning of the season
is really important, and it’s got to be faced; and I tell you
now that any fellow who won’t go through with it honestly
isn’t wanted. But I don’t believe there are any of that sort
here to-day, and I hope there won’t be next Wednesday. I
guess that’s all I have to say. I hope every fellow will
bear in mind the fact that in trying for the crew he is not
only bettering his own physical condition and health, but
standing by the school; he can’t do more for the honor of
Hillton than by honest, sincere work on the crews. And it
doesn’t make any difference whether he makes the varsity
boat or the second; in either case he’s doing his best, doing
his duty; for the fellow that rows with the second eight is
helping to turn out a winning crew almost as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
though he rowed in the race with St. Eustace. I hope we’ll
all pull together this year and that there won’t be any
discord. I’ll do my level best, and I’ll trust you fellows
to do yours; and if that is so I defy St. Eustace or any
one else to beat us!”</p>

<p>The audience showed its approval of these sentiments by
clapping, Taylor perhaps the loudest of all, and Dick,
somewhat red in the face from his effort, smiled, and drawing
a tablet from his pocket, proceeded to take the fellows’
names. Professor Beck settled his glasses again on
his nose and approached a youth who during the proceedings
had been perched comfortably on the top of a radiator,
but who, having secured the entry of his name in the list
of candidates, was now examining with interest the working
of one of the rowing machines.</p>

<p>“You’re Nesbitt, aren’t you?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ever rowed any, Nesbitt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as a youngster”—here the professor smiled
slightly—“I used to paddle a bit; that was in England.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I recollect you now. You won the last quarter
in the relay race the other night; that was well run,
my boy, although you’re rather too heavy for fast work.
How was your wind when you finished?”</p>

<p>“It was rather short; the spurts tuckered me quite
a bit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I imagine you could get rid of eight pounds or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
so to good advantage. You’d better come and see me to-morrow
and take your examination, so that I can put
you to work on the weights as soon as possible. I’m glad
you’re going to try for the crew; you look as though you
were made for a rowing man.” He nodded smilingly and
moved away, and Trevor, assuming an appearance of unconcern,
while secretly much flattered by the professor’s
attention, joined Dick, who had finished his list and was
conversing with Roy Taylor and Crocker, a large, heavily
built youth who had rowed at Number 6 in the second
eight the preceding year. Taylor was speaking when Trevor
approached.</p>

<p>“Why, last winter over forty fellows turned out, and
now look at ’em! Great Scott! There’s no use <em>trying</em> to
get a decent crew out of twenty men!”</p>

<p>Dick frowned, and Crocker offered a suggestion:</p>

<p>“Look here, the Hilltonian comes out in less than a
week; what’s the matter with getting Singer to write a
ripping editorial about the necessity for more candidates,
and—and ‘asking the support of the entire student body,’
and all that sort of stuff? Maybe there’s still time; I’m
blamed if I know when the paper goes to press.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea, Bob,” answered Dick. “And I’ll
see Singer this evening. And meanwhile you fellows do
what you can; you ought to be able to drum up lots of
fellows, Taylor; you know plenty of them, and what you
say has weight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do what I can, Hope, of course, but there
doesn’t seem to be the usual interest in rowing this year.”</p>

<p>“I know; we’ve got to awaken interest. I’ll see you
the last of the week and we’ll have another council of war.
Going back to the room, Nesbitt?”</p>

<p>On their way across the Yard, which between the walks
was a waste of heavily crusted snow upon which the afternoon
sunlight flashed dazzlingly, the two boys were silent—Dick
with the little creases in his forehead very deep, and
Trevor kicking at the ice in a manner which suggested
annoyance. When the dormitory was reached Trevor
stopped and let go savagely at a small cake of ice, which,
as it was securely frozen to the granite step, only resulted
in an unpleasant jar to his foot. But the jar seemed to
loosen his tongue, for he turned quickly to Dick as they
passed into the building, and asked explosively:</p>

<p>“Is that chap Taylor all right?”</p>

<p>“Why? Have you heard anything?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“No; only—only he looks as though he didn’t much
like you, Hope; and then he talks so sick!”</p>

<p>“Sick?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I mean he talks as though he didn’t <em>want</em> the
crew to be a success; haven’t you noticed it?”</p>

<p>“The trouble with Roy Taylor,” answered the other
gravely as they passed into Number 16, “is that he hates
to have any one else win out at anything. He has a mighty
high opinion of Roy Taylor, you know. He wanted to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
captain, and I don’t think he has ever forgiven me for beating
him; but I guess he’ll come round in the end and do his
best for the crew.”</p>

<p>Trevor didn’t look impressed with this last remark. He
studied the flames awhile thoughtfully as he held his hands
up to the warmth. Then:</p>

<p>“I see. I don’t fancy, then, he loves me much after
the way I beat him Saturday night, eh?”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” answered Dick laughingly. “I ‘fancy’
we’re both down in his black book.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Trevor turned away and rummaged among the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of the study table. “Seen my algebra? Never
mind, here it is.” He drew a chair up before the fireplace
and opened the book, only to lay it down again and deliver
himself forcibly of the following declaration:</p>

<p>“Taylor may be as waxy with me as he likes, Hope,
but he’s got to understand that if he interferes with this
crew business there’s a plaguy lot of trouble ahead for
him!”</p>

<p>“And for me, too,” thought Dick, as he gazed despondently
at the slim list of candidates.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE HOCKEY MATCH</small></h2>


<p>The balance of the week was a busy time for Dick.
His usual hour of study before supper was dropped, and
he spent that time with every other spare moment in trying
to recruit candidates for the crews. He buttonholed boys
in classroom and even in chapel, pursued them across the
frozen Yard, waylaid them in the corridors, and bearded
them in their dens; and all with small success. Those who
displayed a willingness to go in for rowing were almost invariably
younger fellows whose ambitions were better developed
than their muscles. Those whom Dick longed to
secure had an excuse for every inducement he could set
forth. The seniors pleaded lessons; the upper middle fellows
were going in for baseball, cricket, anything save rowing;
the lower class boys were unpromising to a degree; and
when Saturday came he found that out of a possible ten
recruits the most promising was a long-legged, pasty-faced
youth who had been dropped from the hockey team and
whose desperate desire to distinguish himself in some manner
was alone accountable for his complaisance.</p>

<p>That Taylor and Crocker and some of the other candidates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
had been busy was evident from the first—Taylor
especially, Dick told himself bitterly.</p>

<p>“Try for the crew?” said one senior whom Dick approached,
“why, Roy Taylor was speaking to me about it,
and I promised him I’d think it over. But I don’t see how
I can, Hope; you know yourself how beastly hard the
studies are this term; I’m an awful duffer at mathematics,
and German, too; and then as for physics—well, really I
can’t see how I’m ever going to pass.” And when Dick
pointed out modestly enough that he (Dick) had the same
studies and was going in for rowing, and expected to
graduate notwithstanding, the other waived the argument
aside carelessly: “Oh, <em>you</em>, Hope! You’re different; you’re
one of those lucky beggars that never have any trouble with
lessons. Why, if I was like you I wouldn’t hesitate an
instant; I’d say put me down for the crew right away. But
as it is—— By the way, is it true that you’ve only got
twenty candidates?”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Taylor, I think. That isn’t very many, is it? I don’t
see how you’ll get a crew out of that.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” muttered Dick, as he turned away discouraged.</p>

<p>When Saturday came, bringing Carl Gray at two
o’clock with the suggestion that Dick join him and witness
the hockey match with St. Eustace, the latter concluded that
he had earned a vacation, and so donned his warmest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sweater and jacket and allowed himself to be torn away
from the subject of candidates. As the two lads crossed
the yard toward the steps that led down to the river by
the boat-house they encountered Trevor, who, when their
destination was made known to him, turned about and
joined them. It was a bitterly cold day, and the wind,
sweeping down the broad river, nipped ears and noses
smartly. Despite this, however, a fair-sized audience had
assembled on the ice near the landing, where a rink had
been marked out, and were either circling about on skates
or tramping to and fro to keep warm.</p>

<p>“Haven’t begun yet,” said Carl Gray as they reached
the head of the steps. “Looks as though they were having
a debate instead of a hockey match.”</p>

<p>As they reached the ice they saw that the captain of
the Hillton team, an upper middle youth named Grove,
was in earnest conversation with a St. Eustace player—apparently
the captain of the opposing team—while
a circle of interested boys surrounded them. As the
three approached the gathering broke up, and Grove,
spying Dick, came toward him looking angry and indignant.</p>

<p>“Say, Hope, what do you think? St. Eustace wants to
play that big dub over there; see him? The fellow with
the white sweater. Why, he’s twenty-two if he’s a day!
And he isn’t a St. Eustace fellow at all; Brown knows him.
He lives at Marshall and works in a mill or something. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
told French that we wouldn’t play if they put him on.
Don’t you think that’s right?”</p>

<p>“He does look rather big and aged for a St. Eustace
chap,” replied Dick with a grin. “And of course if you’re
certain he’s an outsider you’re right not to give in. What
does the St. Eustace captain say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he says the fellow’s a day scholar; that he’s only
eighteen; and that they haven’t brought any subs, and
that if Billings—that’s the mucker’s name—if Billings can’t
play there won’t be any game.”</p>

<p>“Queer thing to come all the way up here without
any subs,” said Carl. “But I tell you what you can do,
Grove; offer to lend them a man. What does Billings
play?”</p>

<p>“Forward,” grumbled Grove. “We might do that.
Who could we give them?”</p>

<p>“You’d have to give them a good player,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Well, there’s Perry over there.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” laughed Dick. “I know Perry; I
talked with him the other day; he’s the fellow you dropped
from the team last week.” Grove looked sheepish.</p>

<p>“Well, what business have they got trying such
tricks?” he muttered in extenuation. “I guess I’ll offer
them Jenkins; he really is a good player, Hope; you know
that yourself; I’ll put Dennison in his place. And if I
do they’ll likely beat us.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em. Go ahead and make the offer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Grove sped away and promptly returned with the announcement
that St. Eustace had agreed. “But we want
another goal umpire. Will you act, Hope?” Dick would,
and was led away. The rink was cleared of spectators, and
Trevor and Carl found places of observation on the side-line.
The opposing teams took their places. The Hillton
players wore crimson sweaters and stockings; before the
St. Eustace goal were six blue-clad youths and one crimson,
the latter being Jenkins, the borrowed forward.
Grove and French, the St. Eustace captain, faced the puck,
the referee cried “Play!” and the game was on.</p>

<p>It proved a brilliant game, despite the high wind that
seriously handicapped the side having the down-river goal.
Hillton’s playing in the first half was quick and plucky,
and for the first ten of the twenty minutes St. Eustace’s
goal was almost constantly in danger. But try after try
was foiled by the brilliant work of the Blue’s goal-tend,
who time and again won the applause of the shivering
audience. Then St. Eustace secured the puck and forced
the playing, and for a few minutes Hillton seemed to be
taken off her feet. A beautifully lifted stroke finally sent
the puck skimming through Hillton’s goal, and the St.
Eustace players waved their sticks in delight. Hillton
braced when play began again, and was dribbling the disk
threateningly toward the Blue’s goal when time was called.</p>

<p>“I wish I had Jenkins back,” complained Grove as,
bundled in his blanket, he joined Trevor and Carl. “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
played better than any fellow on our team—or theirs
either, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“Who shot that goal?” asked Carl.</p>

<p>“French; it was a dandy. Our little friend Billings
yonder looks mad, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>The displaced player had joined the St. Eustace team,
and was evidently bemoaning his fate. He was a tall,
freckle-faced youth who, as Grove had said, appeared every
day of twenty-one or two. He had a slouchy stoop to his
shoulders, but nevertheless looked dangerous as a hockey
player. Dick joined the other three lads.</p>

<p>“I just heard your freckled-faced friend explaining
why it is you’ll never make a good player, Grove,” he
announced. “He says you don’t get low enough; says he
could put you off your feet easily.”</p>

<p>“He does, eh?” grunted Grove. “I wish we’d let him
play; I’d put him off <em>his</em> feet, the big mucker!”</p>

<p>“There, there, keep your sweet little temper,” laughed
Dick. “And come on; time’s up.” The crowd took up its
position along the boundary lines again, and again the puck
was put in play. Hillton had good luck at the start. Superb
team work on the part of the crimson-clad forwards took
the disk down to within striking distance of their opponents’
goal, and a quick drive by Grove sent it through. St.
Eustace’s goal-tend looked surprised and vexed, and the
audience cheered delightedly. Four minutes later the same
proceeding was repeated, and after two ineffectual tries the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
puck slid through between the goal-tend’s skates just where
he apparently didn’t expect it to go. That was Dennison’s
score, and again the onlookers voiced their pleasure. The
score was now two to one in Hillton’s favor, and St. Eustace
shook herself together and played hard. For ten minutes
neither side scored. Then, by a brilliant rush down the side
of the rink, Jenkins, the borrowed player, fooled the Hillton
cover-point, and, aided by French, ran past point and
lifted the disk through between the Hillton posts—a difficult
shot that won him lots of applause. The score was
now tied, with a scant five minutes of play left.</p>

<p>Trevor and Carl, deeply intent on the game, suddenly
had their attention diverted by a voice from near at hand.
“What do you think of that, now? What do those fellers
in red think they’re playing, billiards? O-oh, ain’t that
awful!” It was the deposed St. Eustace forward, Billings,
who was celebrating the Blue’s recent goal, and revenging
himself on his enemies by ridiculing the home players.
Carl glared, and the throng surrounding him looked hostile
to a boy.</p>

<p>“He ought to have sense enough to keep his mouth
shut,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s got pluck to talk that way in this
crowd,” replied Trevor with a grin.</p>

<p>“Not a bit; he knows he’s safe enough. It isn’t likely
that fifty or sixty fellows would jump on one lone chap, no
matter how cheeky he was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The ridicule continued, but after the first recognition
of the affront the throng of Hilltonians tacitly ignored
the freckle-faced youth; indeed, in another minute his existence
was forgotten, for with but a couple of minutes to
play St. Eustace’s point secured the puck, and with a fine
stroke sent it sailing down the rink into Hillton territory,
where a misplay on the part of the Crimson’s cover-point
gave Jenkins his opportunity, and the next instant Hillton’s
goal was besieged. A stroke at close quarters was blocked,
and the disk skimmed toward the side of the rink, only to
be again recovered and dribbled forward until it was once
more in the possession of the redoubtable Jenkins. There
was a rush by Grove and another Hillton forward, the
sound of clashing sticks, and then out from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> like a
shot from a cannon sped the puck, straight for the goal
and about two feet above the ice. The Hillton goal-tend
leaped to the left and turned to receive the disk on his
padded thigh. But he was too late. The puck struck him,
but was only slightly deflected, and in another moment the
St. Eustace sticks were waving high in air, and the goal-tend,
crestfallen and dazed, was ruefully rubbing his hip.
Hillton returned resolutely to the battle, and the puck was
again faced, but time was called ere it was well out of the
scrimmage, and the game was St. Eustace’s by three goals
to two. Trevor turned away in disappointment, and was
confronted by the triumphant Billings, who was whirling
his stick about his head and grinning provokingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, easy, easy! Those kids can’t play hockey; they
ought to be at home doing needlework.” Carl muttered
something uncomplimentary, and Trevor reddened as they
pushed their way through the dissolving throng. Billings,
spying Trevor as he approached, thrust himself in his
path.</p>

<p>“Say, sonny, why don’t you kids learn the game?”</p>

<p>Trevor strove to keep his temper and pass, but the Marshall
youth laid a determining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“You see, sonny, what you Hillton kids want to do is
to learn how to skate, see? There ain’t any use trying to
play hockey until you can skate.”</p>

<p>Trevor turned and smiled very sweetly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think you can skate?” he asked in a tone
of polite inquiry.</p>

<p>“I have a hunch that way,” replied Billings with a
swagger.</p>

<p>“That’s very nice,” answered Trevor, “because you
don’t look as though you could, you know.”</p>

<p>A circle of interested Hilltonians had already formed,
and were grinning their appreciation. Billings appeared
somewhat astounded for an instant. Then he thrust his
jaw out aggressively, and asked angrily:</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with you, kid? Do you think
you can teach me anything about skating?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, I’m a month or two younger than
you, you know”—here the crowd snickered impolitely—“but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
I rather fancy that I can beat you by a few yards
in a half-mile race. Would you care to try?”</p>

<p>For a moment Billings looked doubtful. Possibly he
thought that he had unwittingly encountered the school’s
crack skater, and feared for the result. If he did the idea
was dispelled by Trevor’s next remark.</p>

<p>“They don’t call me much of a skater here, you know;
we have several fellows who can beat me without trouble,
but they’re all rather busy just at present, and so, if you
don’t mind putting up with something ordinary, I’ll be glad
to show you what I can about skating.” The gentle patronage
of Trevor’s tones was beautiful, and the audience hugged
itself gleefully. Billings laughed loudly and scornfully.</p>

<p>“You will, eh? Say, you’re awfully nice, aren’t you?
Mama know you’re out?” Trevor reddened but kept his
temper.</p>

<p>“I fancy I could beat you by about twenty yards in
a half mile,” he said musingly.</p>

<p>That was the last straw, and Billings elbowed his way
toward the boat-house landing.</p>

<p>“Get your skates on, sonny, and I’ll show you what
you don’t know about skating.”</p>

<p>“Where can I get a pair?” asked Trevor, addressing the
fellows about him.</p>

<p>“Get Grove’s; what size shoe do you wear?” asked
Carl. “Five? They ought to fit; wait here and I’ll get
them.” And he hurried off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think you can beat him, ’Ighness?” asked one
of the crowd.</p>

<p>“I fancy so; anyhow, I’ll do my best.” Carl returned
with Groves skating-boots, to which were screwed a superb
pair of hockey skates. Trevor tried them on, and found
that they fitted perfectly. News of the proposed race had
spread, and those who had started toward their rooms had
returned, while the two hockey teams, having taken off
their skates and donned their heavy clothing, also joined
the throng. Billings swept up majestically, and Trevor,
who had been trying his skates in short circles, joined him.</p>

<p>“Suppose you skate around Long Isle and back,” suggested
Grove; “that’s about a half mile. We’ll draw a
mark here for the finish. I say, French, you might act as
judge at the finish. Dick, you start them, will you?”</p>

<p>“Standing start?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>Trevor looked inquiringly at Billings. “Doesn’t matter
to me,” growled that youth.</p>

<p>“All right. On your marks,” said Dick. “You’re to
skate to the right, around Long Isle, and return here, crossing
this line in this way from below. Is that satisfactory?”</p>

<p>Trevor nodded and felt for a hold with his rear blade,
and Billings uttered another growl.</p>

<p>“On your marks!—Set!—<em>Go!</em>”</p>

<p>Away they sped, Billings slightly in the lead, having
learned the science of quick starting from his hockey experience.
They crossed the river diagonally, heading for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the down-stream end of the island, Billings bending low,
hands clasped behind his back, in the approved style of
American racers; Trevor more erect, arms swinging by his
sides, and apparently putting forth much less effort than his
competitor.</p>

<p>“Carl, can Nesbitt skate?” asked Dick somewhat anxiously.
Carl shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me. I never met him until the other day.
But he <em>can</em> skate; we can see that; the question is how
well?”</p>

<p>“I hope he’ll win, if only to shut that bragging mucker
up. Hello, look there!”</p>

<p>Carl looked and uttered a groan of dismay. Long
Isle, lying almost abreast of the boat landing and about
two thirds way across the river, is in reality composed of
not one, but two islands, the second, scarcely twenty yards
long, being separated from the main expanse at its lower
end by a scant two yards of ice-covered channel. This fact
had been overlooked, and now the watchers saw, at first
with surprise and then with annoyance, that the skaters had
parted company. Billings had headed for the channel,
while Trevor, holding to a close interpretation of the agreement,
was making for the end of the smaller island. The
next moment Billings was out of sight; another instant and
Trevor too had disappeared.</p>

<p>“If Nesbitt can overcome that handicap he’s a good
one,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so,” Carl assented. “It means a good fifty
yards lost, I guess.” Some of the boys had hurried across
the ice to the island, and from a point of vantage near its
northern end were to be seen waving their arms wildly.
But the throng at the finish could gather no hint from
their gestures as to the progress of the racers.</p>

<p>“Evidently a misunderstanding there,” said French,
the St. Eustace captain, approaching Grove. “Which is
Long Isle?”</p>

<p>“Both of ’em,” grunted Grove.</p>

<p>“Well, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, I guess; Billings wasn’t supposed to
know; it was my fault; I forgot about that plaguy little
bunch of land beyond there. The fellow that crosses first
wins,” he added decisively. “What do you say, Hope?”</p>

<p>“That’s right; Billings couldn’t know that he was supposed
to go around both islands.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered French, “but I’m sorry there
was any misunderstanding. Your man may think that he
might have won if it hadn’t been for the mistake.”</p>

<p>“He may win anyhow,” said Dick dryly. “The race
isn’t over yet.” French looked to see if Dick was joking,
but finding no signs of levity, smiled politely and deprecatingly,
and moved off. The next moment the boys on
the island left their places and came scrambling back across
the ice, and then a skater came into view around the up-river
end of the island and headed for the finish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Billings,” said Dick in disappointed tones. But
ere the words were out of his mouth a second form sped
into sight, and a cheer went up from the watchers. Trevor
was apparently but a half dozen yards behind, and, although
as the racers were coming directly toward the group it
was impossible to be certain on that point, seemed to be
gaining at every stride.</p>

<p>Carl slapped Dick boisterously on the shoulder and then
hugged him ecstatically. “Can ’Is ’Ighness skate, Dick?
<em>Can he skate?</em>”</p>

<p>“Can he!” howled Dick. “Look, he’s even with him;
he’s—by Jupiter, Carl, he’s ahead of him!”</p>

<p>He was; and not only ahead now, but leading by a
good three yards. Every voice was raised in shouts of encouragement,
and cries of “Hurry up, Billings!” “Come
on, Nesbitt!” “You can beat him! Brace up!” “Bully
for Hillton!” broke into the frosty air as the two racers,
bearing down swiftly, almost silently, on the finish line,
sped nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Twenty yards away Trevor threw a fleeting glance over
his shoulder at his straining rival, and then, suddenly bending
lower over the leaden-hued surface, fairly left the other
standing and shot through the lane in the crowd and over
the line <a href="#image04">a winner by ten</a> long <a href="#image04">yards</a>!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_90">A winner by ten yards.</a></div>
</div>

<p>And how Hillton howled!</p>

<p>“Even old ‘Turkey’ couldn’t beat that!” exulted Carl.</p>

<p>Trevor swung about near shore and skated leisurely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
back to where Billings, red-faced and panting, was explaining
to French and the rest of the St. Eustace team how it
happened. But his friends looked utterly bored at his narrative,
and turned away one by one toward the landing
steps. Trevor came to a stop a yard in front of the tall,
freckle-faced youth, who paused in his explanation and
regarded him angrily. The crowd hushed its chatter in
delighted anticipation. Trevor thrust his hands under his
sweater and regarded Billings with a wealth of genial condescension.</p>

<p>“Any time you’d like to learn more about skating,” he
remarked sweetly, “come up. I’m always at leisure Saturday
afternoons.”</p>

<p>Then he nodded amiably and skated away ere the outraged
Billings could summon his scattered wits to the rescue
of his equally scattered dignity.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>BUYING AN ICE-YACHT</small></h2>


<p>“An ice-yacht,” observed Carl learnedly, “is the nearest
approach at the present age to a flying-machine.”</p>

<p>“And I never cared a bit about flying,” answered Dick,
without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The two, with Trevor and Stewart Earle, were gathered
close about the fireplace in Number 16 Masters. Two good
hickory logs were crackling merrily, and, although owing
to the fact that the steam-heating apparatus was evidently
on a strike and their backs were constantly
caressed by shivers, their knees and faces were radiantly
warm; and that was sufficient comfort. A huge paper bag
was perched on the table, and the quartet were busily
munching big, rosy apples, while close to the ashes four
more were sizzling and sputtering in the heat. They had
started out with the intention of having a feast of roasted
apples, but had found that the roasting process was too
slow to meet the demands of their appetites, and so were
keeping down the pangs of starvation in the interims by
consuming the fruit as Nature had meant they should.</p>

<p>“An ice-yacht,” continued Carl, undismayed, “can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
put together very easily and cheaply. All you have to have
is four pieces of timber and——”</p>

<p>“Look here, Carl,” interrupted Dick impolitely, “the
last thing you made was a toboggan, and it cost about nine
dollars before you were through with it, and you could
have bought a <em>good</em> one for five.” Stewart giggled and
Carl grinned good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s buy one, then,” he replied. “Let’s go
down to Euston Point and see the one this fellow advertises.”</p>

<p>“How much do they cost?” asked Trevor.</p>

<p>“Oh, we could get a second-hand one for fifteen dollars,
easy; maybe less. That would be only four dollars apiece,
if we all went in. And we could have the biggest kind
of fun! Why, some ice-yachts go as fast as ninety miles
an hour!”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!”</p>

<p>“They do; don’t they, Stew?”</p>

<p>“Easy,” answered Stewart gravely. “I’ve seen lots of
them do it. I owned one myself once that could go a hundred
and thirty-seven miles in——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you idiot!” growled Carl. “What do you
say, fellows; shall we see if we can get the boat? Think
how jolly grouchy the other chaps would be to see us skipping
around and——”</p>

<p>“And breaking our necks,” suggested Trevor.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort! Why, it’s not dangerous at all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
any one that knows anything about sailing a yacht can
manage an ice-boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, who knows anything about sailing among this
crowd? Do you, Trevor?”</p>

<p>Trevor shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> do, of course,” interrupted Carl.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Stewart, “as far as I’m concerned I think
I’d rather have some one else than you do it, Carl.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quit fooling; I’m in earnest. Suppose we go to
Euston Point next Saturday and see what’s doing?”</p>

<p>“But, look here,” said Dick, “how do you know
Faculty will let us sail the thing if we get it?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t they? They allow skating; ice-yachting’s
just skating—with a difference. Besides, as long as
there’s no rule against it we have a right to do it.”</p>

<p>This argument was incontrovertible, and it was agreed
that the four should journey to the near-by village of
Euston Point the following Saturday morning. And then
Stewart suddenly discovered that the apples on the hearth
had been done for some time, and in the business that followed
the subject of ice-yachting was forgotten.</p>

<p>When Dick and Trevor returned from supper that
evening they found a fresh, inky-smelling number of The
Hilltonian awaiting them in the letter-box. Dick hurried
to the room with it and spread it out under the light on
the table. Yes, Singer had been as good as his word; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
leading editorial was headed The Rowing Situation, and
was quite in Singer’s best style.</p>

<p>“My!” ejaculated Trevor, who had been reading the
article over Dick’s shoulder, “that’s spiffin!”</p>

<p>“It sounds rather well, doesn’t it?” asked Dick, highly
gratified by the effusion. “And you’d think it would bring
some of the fellows round, eh?”</p>

<p>“Bound to; you’ll find slathers of them in the gym
to-morrow afternoon,” replied Trevor confidently. “Read
it out loud, Hope.”</p>

<p>And Dick did so and Trevor listened admiringly and
interpolated an applauding “Hear, hear!” at intervals,
and Dick went to bed very hopeful of the morrow.</p>

<p>But when at three o’clock the following afternoon he
repaired to the rowing-room his heart sank. Aside from
the original nineteen candidates, but the veriest handful
were present. Dick counted them grimly; there were fourteen
of them, and for the most part they not only looked
but really were sadly out of their element. A small junior
of perhaps fourteen tried to hide himself in a corner, but
Dick routed him out mercilessly and asked him cruelly if
he was a candidate for coxswain.</p>

<p>“Yes—no—that is, I don’t know,” was the breathless
reply. Dick turned away and encountered the mocking
gaze of Taylor, who, when Dick’s eyes were turned upon
him, smoothed his features into an expression of respectful
concern and walked forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“What an outfit, eh?” he asked softly. But Dick was
resolved that the other should not have the satisfaction of
knowing his disappointment. He shrugged his shoulders
and smiled carelessly.</p>

<p>“Well, they don’t look brilliant; a bit light on an
average; but I dare say we’ll be able to find some good
material in the lot.” At that moment Professor Beck entered.
After a slow and careful glance up and down the
long room he looked fleetingly at Dick, frowned, and turned
away. But he made no remarks upon the showing of candidates
save once.</p>

<p>“Mr. Kirk will coach the crews again this year,” he
announced, “and will be with you every Saturday afternoon
until the river opens, when, as last year, he will come
up to Hillton and stay with you until the race. I expect
he will make his first visit a week from next Saturday, and
I’m sure”—he glanced blandly over the audience—“I’m
sure he will be greatly pleased with the material he will
find.”</p>

<p>Something approaching a shudder passed over the
throng, and Dick turned aside to hide a grim smile. Then
the first batch of candidates trooped off to the locker room
to don gymnasium attire, and the new recruits were registered,
instructed to report for examination the following
afternoon, and dismissed looking heartily relieved. When
the last one had gone Professor Beck heaved a sigh and
turned to Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hope, are you certain there was no mistake made?
You’re sure you didn’t issue a call for candidates for a
tiddledy-winks team?” Dick smiled dismally.</p>

<p>“No, there’s no such luck. We’ve got thirty-four fellows,
of which a possible two dozen are rowing material.”</p>

<p>“Hum; I think we shall be able to turn out an excellent
second eight, but as for a varsity crew—do you happen to
have an idea as to where we are going to get that, Hope?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I haven’t,” replied Dick miserably. Professor
Beck polished his glasses thoughtfully for a minute and
studied the wintry landscape through the high window.
Then he smiled, settled the shining lenses again on his nose,
and turned toward the door.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to use our wits, Hope. Above all, don’t
allow yourself to become discouraged. We still have a
couple of weeks before us, and—well, I guess we can accomplish
something in that time. Are you ready?”</p>

<p>Together they passed out onto the floor and in a few
minutes the first squad of crew candidates had begun their
training. Of the twenty, two had rowed in the varsity
boat of the preceding year, four had rowed with the second
eight, three had trained as substitutes, and the balance,
eleven candidates, represented new and inexperienced
material as far as shell-rowing was concerned. Well-nigh
all were what Trevor would have termed “wetbobs,” and
had paddled about in tubs or perhaps rowed now and then
in a pair-oar. Professor Beck and Dick were busy for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
half hour that constituted the first day’s exercising. Generally
speaking, each candidate required a different work
from his neighbors. In Brown the forearm muscles were
undeveloped; in Smith the chest muscles had been neglected;
in Jones the back was as unbending as a two-inch
plank, while Robinson, perchance, was in a state of general
flabbiness. The professor viewed attentively the work of
each boy, altered the exercise here, stopped it there, increased
it elsewhere, while Dick stood beside him, listening to
his instructions and memorizing, as pointed out to him, the
needs of the different ones. After awhile the fellows were
sent to the track for the briefest of trots, and so, having
stood for an instant under a shower-bath, dressed, and went
their ways full-fledged crew candidates, with an inalienable
right to look down condescendingly upon their schoolmates,
to cut Friday night lectures, and comport themselves generally
in the manner of coming heroes.</p>

<p>And Dick, with Trevor at his side, went back to his
room for an hour of study before supper, not overjoyful,
but yet somewhat comforted by the professor’s hopefulness
and by the fact that real work had at last commenced.</p>

<p>On Friday night Professor Beck announced to Dick
that the fourteen newer candidates had been examined, and
in five instances found wanting. “Of those that remain,”
said the professor, “two look like good men; as for the
rest——” He shrugged his shoulders eloquently. “But we
can tell better in a week or two. Meanwhile, we must keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
up the recruiting. I have my eye on an upper middle boy,
and I think I’ll have him hooked in a day or two. If we
can secure say another half dozen good men I think we
can pull out all right.”</p>

<p>The next morning—it being a bright and sunny Saturday
toward the last of January—Dick, Trevor, Carl, and
Stewart boarded the train and traveled to Euston Point,
but a few miles distant, where they called on the man
whose advertisement Carl had read in a local paper, and by
him were conducted to a loft by the river, where a dilapidated-looking
triangle of timbers and bolts—which its
owner declared loudly was the fastest cat-rigged yacht on
the Hudson—was shown to them. The bargain was soon
closed, Carl conducting the negotiations and talking learnedly
of runner planks, center timbers, and stays. The boat
was to be supplied with a new rudder-post, a new sail and
rigging, the runners were to be reground, and the whole
was to be delivered at the boat landing at Hillton Academy
four days from that date for the munificent sum of seventeen
dollars and seventy-five cents. Carl was elated.</p>

<p>“We’ve saved two dollars and a quarter,” he declared.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” objected Dick. “You told us last
week that we could get the thing for fifteen dollars.”</p>

<p>“I know I did; that’s what I thought. But you heard
him ask twenty at first, didn’t you? Well, and I jewed
him down to seventeen seventy-five. Isn’t that two and
a quarter saved?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick had to acknowledge that it was, and Carl insisted
on celebrating his successful financiering by treating to
very nasty hot soda at the town’s only drug store. And
so to Carl’s business acumen may be traced the series of
events that led shortly to Trevor’s disgrace.</p>

<p>Their way to the station took them past the open door
of a livery stable. When they were abreast of it something
round and white shot out, rolled over and over down the
little incline, and brought up at Trevor’s feet. It proved
to be a young puppy, which, when it stopped rolling, found
its four unsteady feet, barked joyously, and tried to gnaw
the buttons from Trevor’s trouser cuffs. But he was instantly
seized upon and elevated in Trevor’s arms for the
inspection of the others.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a little beauty?” cried Trevor.</p>

<p>“Yes; what is he, a fox terrier?” asked Stewart, allowing
the squirming and delighted puppy to chew his gloved
fingers to its heart’s content.</p>

<p>“Fox terrier!” replied Trevor scathingly. “Of course
not; it’s a bull. Look at that nose!”</p>

<p>“I am looking at it,” answered Dick. “Nice and ugly,
isn’t it? What makes it so pink?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it ought to be,” answered Trevor with
fine disdain for his friend’s ignorance. “I wonder who it
belongs to?”</p>

<p>“Belongs right here, sir!” The boys glanced around
and found a colored stableman observing them smilingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
from the doorway. Trevor placed the puppy upon the
ground, where it at once relapsed into a state of loud and
poignant grief, leaping with snowy feet against his stockings,
and crying vehemently to be again taken up. Trevor
patted it, whereupon its grief gave place to uncontrollable
delight; it stood on its hind legs, buried its short
nose in a small snow-bank, and attempted to take the boy’s
entire hand into its pink mouth, and all within the instant.</p>

<p>“It’s the liveliest pup I ever saw,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine dog, sir,” said the owner. “His mother
took a first and two second prizes at the dog show last week,
and his father’s got lots of ’em. Yes, siree, he’s a mighty
fine dog, he is.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Dick, “we’ll lose the train if we’re
not careful.”</p>

<p>But Trevor paid no heed. He was looking intently at
the puppy, which, with the boy’s left thumb between his
teeth, was radiantly happy.</p>

<p>“He’s got a pedigree as long as yer arm,” continued the
stableman.</p>

<p>“Has he?” muttered Trevor.</p>

<p>“He can be registered ter-morrer, he can; he’s blue-blooded
right through, he is.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” said Trevor. The puppy was now on its back,
legs limply aloft, and Trevor was thoughtfully rubbing a
pink-and-white stomach.</p>

<p>“Was you wanting to buy a dog, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-no, I think not,” answered Trevor.</p>

<p>“Say, come on, Nesbitt, or we’ll be late,” cried Carl.</p>

<p>The stableman glanced over his shoulder. “Lots of
time, gentlemen; train ain’t due for twelve minutes yet.”
Then, addressing Trevor, “I had four of them and sold ’em
all ’cept this one; an’ he’s the best of the lot; an’ cheap, too—dirt
cheap.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Trevor with elaborate carelessness.</p>

<p>“You can have him for five dollars.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” said Stewart.</p>

<p>“Give you fifty cents,” said Carl. The stableman
turned indignantly.</p>

<p>“I reckon you don’t know much about what bulldogs
is worth,” he said. “This gentleman here knows that that
ain’t too much for a puppy as fine as that one; don’t you,
sir?”</p>

<p>“I dare say he’s worth that much,” answered Trevor,
“but I couldn’t pay it.”</p>

<p>“What would you do with it if you had it?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“Now, look here; I’ll tell you what I’ll do, sir,” said
the stableman. “You can have him for three dollars and
a half. And that’s mighty cheap, that is.”</p>

<p>Trevor looked longingly at the puppy, who was now for
the moment quiescent, and who was gazing up into Trevor’s
face as though breathlessly awaiting his verdict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I’ll give you a dollar to-day and pay you the rest
next Saturday,” he said finally.</p>

<p>“You one of the Hillton young gentlemen?” asked the
stableman.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can take him along. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>Trevor gave it amid the expostulations of his friends,
who asked wonderingly where he expected to keep his new
possession, how long he thought Faculty would let him have
it, and how he was going to get it home. To all of which
Trevor made no reply. Paying the man the first instalment
of the money, he seized upon the delighted puppy and
strode off, fearful lest the former owner should regret the
bargain and change his mind.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” ejaculated Dick. “Where in
thunder will you keep him?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” answered Trevor. “I’ll find a
place.”</p>

<p>“What’s troubling me,” complained Carl, “is how
you’re going to pay your four dollars and forty-four cents
toward the yacht and the three dollars and a half for the
pup.”</p>

<p>Trevor looked blank.</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten about the yacht,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Forgotten about it!” cried Carl. “Why, man alive,
we just bought it ten minutes ago!”</p>

<p>“I know. But—I tell you—I’ll write to the pater;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
I fancy he’ll send me money enough for the puppy;
he always gives me any money I may need for useful
things.”</p>

<p>The others exploded into violent laughter.</p>

<p>“Call that useful?” gurgled Dick, holding his sides and
pointing derisively at the puppy, which lay limp but blissful
with half-closed eyes in Trevor’s arms. A warning
whistle made unnecessary any reply, and the four boys hurried
toward the station.</p>

<p>“You’d better hide him under your coat, or else they’ll
make you ride in the baggage car with him,” cautioned
Dick. And so Trevor boarded the train with a suspicious
portliness, happily unobserved of the conductor, and, when
they had yielded their tickets, drew the uncomplaining
puppy from under his sweater.</p>

<p>“I’ll say one thing for it,” remarked Carl grudgingly,
“it behaves mighty well, considering that it has just been
torn from home and parents.” He held out a hand and
the puppy went into spasms of delight over the evidence
of friendship and licked the fingers deliriously. “Funny
little beggar! How old is it, Trevor?”</p>

<p>“About ten weeks, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to call him?” asked Stewart.</p>

<p>Trevor shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. I shall wait until I find something
appropriate.”</p>

<p>“Talking about names,” said Carl, “let’s find one for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the boat. That fellow said she was the Lucy G., but that’s
silly and doesn’t mean anything.”</p>

<p>“Ought to be something wintry,” suggested Stewart.</p>

<p>“Something like Blizzard, or Snowflake, or Ice King,”
added Dick.</p>

<p>“It can’t be any of those,” objected Carl, “because
there are heaps of Blizzards and the other things you said.
How would The Polar Bear do?”</p>

<p>Every one sniffed derisively.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Trevor, “if it must be something wintry,
what’s the matter with The Ulster or The Cough Drop?”</p>

<p>“Or The Chilblain?” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“I think a good name would be The Sleet,” Stewart
struck in. “That’s wintry enough.”</p>

<p>A vote was taken, and The Sleet carried.</p>

<p>“We can have a sail next Saturday,” suggested Carl.</p>

<p>“So soon?” groaned Dick. “Carl, we’re so young
to die!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my funny friend, but just you wait
until I get to sailing that thing; you’ll see!”</p>

<p>And Carl’s prediction, though vague, proved in a measure
correct.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>ADVENTURES OF A BULL PUP</small></h2>


<p>Trevor smuggled the puppy into his room undetected,
against Dick’s advice.</p>

<p>“If Faculty finds it out you’ll not only lose the animal,
but get into trouble. And they’re bound to learn of it
before long. Why, the ‘goody’ will see the thing when
she makes the beds.”</p>

<p>“No, she won’t; I’ll find a way to fix that,” answered
Trevor confidently.</p>

<p>“But how’ll you keep him alive?” asked Dick. “The
poor little thing has got to eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can bring him something from dining-hall.”</p>

<p>Dick shrugged his shoulders and gave up the argument.
And having relieved his conscience by his protest, joined his
roommate in teaching the puppy to sit on his hind legs
and hold a piece of cracker on his nose: a feat which the
animal could not for a long time see the philosophy of.
When, however, he discovered that obedience invariably
gave him possession of the fragment of biscuit to crumble
to his heart’s content over the hearth-rug, he began to
understand the game, and to even show a certain pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in it. After the work in the gymnasium that afternoon
Trevor and Dick walked to the village and the former purchased—I
regret to say on credit, thereby infringing one of
the rules—a red leather collar and a steel chain. When
Trevor left the dining-hall after supper his coat pockets
bulged suspiciously, and later the puppy feasted regally on
cold roast beef and graham bread, while the two boys
watched every mouthful with delight. When bedtime
came Trevor arranged a pair of old tennis trousers by the
hearth, and placing the puppy thereon, assured him sternly
that he was expected to remain there quietly until morning.</p>

<p>Perhaps Trevor’s commands were not altogether clear.
That as may be, he had no sooner put out the light and
snuggled himself into bed than there arose a sound of
grief and dismay in the study, followed presently by tiny
footfalls on the bedroom floor.</p>

<p>“Lie down!” commanded Trevor sternly.</p>

<p>The whining ceased for a minute, and a tail thumped
the floor delightedly. And then, as no further recognition
seemed forthcoming, the whining began again in increased
volume and with added pathos.</p>

<p>“Puppy, go lie down,” whispered Trevor, more mildly
this time. Dick was laughing silently beyond in the darkness.
The puppy again thumped the floor with his tail.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s cold,” suggested Dick.</p>

<p>“The poor little fellow wants to get up on the bed, I
fancy,” answered Trevor. “I’ll spread my dressing-gown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
for him at the foot.” This was done, and the disturbing
element was hauled to the bed by the nape of his neck.
But stay on the dressing-gown he would not, and Trevor
finally fell asleep with the small, warm bundle of dog lying
against his breast, and a tiny, bullet-shaped head resting
peacefully on his neck.</p>

<p>The real troubles began next morning. When the two
boys started for breakfast they locked the door carefully,
and had reached the stairs, when, faint but unmistakable
as to character, came a long howl of grief. Fearfully, Trevor
hurried back. The puppy was sitting erect and tragic
just inside the door. His delight at Trevor’s return was,
however, short-lived, for he was ignominiously shut in the
closet, and Trevor, with the key in his pocket, again set
forth. But he could find little enjoyment in breakfast, for
all the while he was haunted by the fear that the “goody”
would get into the room before he could return, hear the
dog’s howls, and report the matter to Professor Tomkins,
the resident instructor. He hurried back to Masters with
his meal but half eaten, and breathed a sigh of relief when
he found the beds still unmade and the room still untidied.
From the closet came eager, questioning sniffs and whines of
impatience. Trevor opened the door, tossed in a mutton
chop, and quickly secured it again. And then the study
door opened and the “goody” entered.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Nesbitt.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mrs. Pratt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Trevor seized a Latin book, subsided into a chair by the
closet and tried to read. From behind the locked door
came sounds of busy gnawings; once a diminutive growl
was audible. But the “goody” was in the other room and
so all was safe. Trevor discovered that he was holding the
book upside down; he corrected the mistake and wondered
why it was that the beds took so long to make this morning
of all others. They were finally completed, however, and
the crucial moment arrived. Armed with dust-cloth, the
woman came out and slowly began to move about the study.
Suddenly from behind the locked door came two distinct
taps; it was only the puppy worrying the mutton bone, but
the “goody” didn’t know that, and looked in alarm toward
the closet.</p>

<p>“What was that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“What was what?” asked Trevor.</p>

<p>“That sound; them sounds—in there?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, you’re dreaming; there—there’s no one
in——”</p>

<p>Something bumped softly against the door; the woman
glanced suspiciously from Trevor to the closet. Trevor
looked carelessly out the window and began to whistle. A
low whine issued from the prison. Trevor heard it, but apparently
the “goody” didn’t; he whistled louder. The
whining increased. Trevor began to sing.</p>

<p>Then began a most appalling series of bumps, growls,
knocks, whines, jars, gnawings, and similar disturbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
noises from the closet. With loudly thumping heart Trevor
sang on, rapidly, loudly, unceasingly. The woman
turned and viewed him in astonishment not unmixed with
alarm. Trevor’s singing was more creditable from the point
of vigor and whole-souledness than on the score of harmony
or rhythm. His notes were nearly all flats, which, with
the fact that he never for an instant varied the time, made
even the most joyous of ballads lugubrious when performed
by him. He had finished In the Gloaming, Way down
upon the Suwanee River, and Rule, Britannia, and was
now breathlessly, heroically thundering forth Hilltonians
in tones that could be, and probably were, heard in the
next dormitory:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hilltonians, Hilltonians, your crimson banner fling”<br /></span>
<span class="i7">(Bang! Bump! Gr-r-r-r!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Unto the breeze, and ’neath its folds your anthem loudly sing!”<br /></span>
<span class="i7">(Whack! Bang! Bump!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hilltonians, Hilltonians, our loyalty we’ll prove<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beneath the flag, the crimson flag, the bonny flag we love!”<br /></span>
<span class="i7">(Gr-r-r-r! Ao-o-oow! Ao-o-o-ow! Bang!)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And then, with her hands over her ears and her dust-cloth
trailing in defeat, the “goody” fled from the room,
and the day was won! Trevor sank back exhausted. From
the closet the strange sounds continued to issue. He sat
up and stared fearfully at the closed door. What, he
asked himself with sinking heart, what could they mean?
He drew forth the key, crossed the room, unlocked the
door, threw it open, and—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Out tumbled the puppy and—and—could it be? It
could; it was!—one of Dick’s immaculate patent-leather
pumps, torn and chewed into as sorry a looking object as
he had ever seen!</p>

<p>At sight of Trevor the puppy dropped his prize, put his
small head on one side, wagged his tail proudly, and gazed
up at his master as though asking “How’s that for a good
job well done?”</p>

<p>Trevor peered into the closet and groaned. The floor
was a mass of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>; shoes and garments from the hooks
were writhed together madly; and everywhere was set the
puppy’s mark of approval. Trevor gathered up the garments
and returned them to their hooks. A cold, blunt nose
thrust itself into the way. Trevor’s hand rose and fell
smartly twice, and with a yelp the puppy retreated to the
hearth-rug, where he turned and barked defiance.</p>

<p>Trevor observed him wrathfully for an instant, but his
attitude of insulted dignity and his ferocious challenge to
combat were so ludicrous that the boy subsided amid the
wreckage and laughed until the tears came. And the
puppy, bounding joyfully upon him, instantly forgiving,
gurgled his pleasure and licked his hands, shoes, and face
with whole-souled impartiality.</p>

<p>And upon this scene entered Dick!</p>

<p>Let us draw the curtain.</p>

<p>That night, long after Dick had dropped off to slumber,
he was awakened by Trevor’s urgent voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dick! Dick! Wake up!”</p>

<p>“Wha-what’s the matter?” cried Dick, starting suddenly
from sleep, and sitting up in bed with confused visions
of fire and flood.</p>

<p>“I’ve found a name for him,” answered Trevor triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Name? What name? Who’s name?”</p>

<p>“The puppy’s. I’m going to call him Muggins!”</p>

<p>Dick snorted wrathfully and went back to sleep.</p>

<p>Trevor fondled the slumberous puppy. “Isn’t he an
unfeeling brute, Muggins?” he whispered. And Muggins
thumped his tail affirmatively, sleepily.</p>

<p>The following night, when all was silent in the dormitory,
a form bundled against the weather in a greatcoat,
and followed by a second form, vastly smaller in outline
and wearing only the coat that nature had provided him
with, might have been seen—but were not—tiptoeing from
study No. 16 and descending the creaking stairs. The door
was locked, but the key was there, and in a moment the two
forms had vanished into outer darkness and the portal had
closed again.</p>

<p>As the discerning reader has no doubt already surmised,
the mysterious forms were those of Trevor and
Muggins.</p>

<p>Trevor had concluded that Muggins’s health demanded
more exercise than his puppyship was getting, and so on the
preceding night and again to-night Muggins, at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the steel chain, had been surreptitiously conveyed from
the building for a stroll about the yard. It was bitterly
cold and Trevor shivered as he ambled slowly toward the
gymnasium followed by the dog; but since Muggins’s health
demanded exercise Muggins should have it, though the thermometer
stood at miles below zero, which luckily it didn’t
to-night. Around the gymnasium plodded Trevor, slipping,
sliding on the icy walks; around trotted Muggins,
sniffing, shivering in the nipping wind. Then down the path
by Bradley to Turner, around the corner of Turner,
and——</p>

<p>Alas, tragedy was in the air that night!</p>

<p>Trevor paused, listening. Footsteps sounded loudly,
frostily at a little distance, and in the darkness a dim form
loomed up from the direction of the gate. It was but the
work of an instant to slink into the recess of the building
made by the protruding entrance, and to pull Muggins after
him. The footsteps drew nearer. One of the professors
returning late from the village, Trevor told himself. The
form came abreast of him, a scant two yards distant, and
was almost past his hiding-place when Muggins awoke to
the demands of the occasion.</p>

<p>Muggins, despite his tender age, was valor to the tip of
his wagging tail. He heard strange footsteps; he saw a
strange form; he feared an attack on his master. But, what
ho! was not he, Muggins, there? Certainly! And—</p>

<p>Away went the chain from Trevor’s numbed fingers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
away went Muggins, dashing to the fray like a knight
of old!</p>

<p>“<em>Bow! Bow-wow!</em>” challenged Muggins.</p>

<p>Trevor heard an ejaculation of alarmed surprise, saw
the form of the tall professor jump back, and then—then
there was a crash, and Trevor, seizing the opportunity,
was off like the wind, and had gained the doorway of Masters
Hall ere the astonished professor had regained his feet.
For Muggins in his excess of valor had got his small body
between his adversary’s legs, and great and sudden was
the fall. Trevor waited long at the entrance of Masters
Hall, standing with door ajar and peering anxiously into
the darkness; once even venturing upon a subdued whistle
and a yearning “Muggins, Muggins!” But his appeals
were vain, and after a while he crept dejectedly upstairs
and back into his cold and Muggins-less bed, wondering,
sorrowful, fearful of the morrow.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>MUGGINS IS EXPELLED</small></h2>


<p>Dick learned the story the next morning while the
boys were dressing, and, to Trevor’s pained surprise, subsided
onto the hearth-rug, where he sprawled at length, and gave
way to heartless mirth.</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say <em>you</em> don’t care,” said Trevor with
wounded dignity. “He wasn’t <em>your</em> dog. If he had been”—savagely—“I
dare say <em>I</em> should have laughed!” Dick
stopped rolling and sat up against the wood-box.</p>

<p>“But—but, don’t you see, Trevor,” he gurgled, “I’m—I’m
not laughing because you’ve lost Buggins——”</p>

<p>“Muggins,” corrected Trevor coldly.</p>

<p>“I—I mean Muggins. I’m awfully sorry about that,
honest injun! But—but think of Longworth—it must
have been Longworth, you see—think of him rolling over
there on the ice, all tangled up with Bug—Muggins and
the chain! Oh, jiminy!” And Dick went off into another
spasm of laughter.</p>

<p>Trevor stared thoughtfully into the flames, trying to
summon up the picture that appeared so delightful to his
roommate. After a moment he smiled faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I see; yes, I fancy it was comical. But—but
wasn’t it awfully brave of Muggins?”</p>

<p>“Awfully,” answered Dick with emphasis as he sat up
again, dried his eyes with a towel, and proceeded with his
dressing. “Perhaps you’ll find him again.”</p>

<p>But Trevor shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“No chance of that. Poor Muggins!”</p>

<p>After chapel that morning Professor Wheeler, the principal,
arose. “One of the professors while returning
through the yard late last evening came across a—a young
dog wearing a collar and chain. There are reasons to believe
that the animal belongs to one of you, as the professor
caught sight of a boy running toward a dormitory.”</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise, amusement, and excitement
traveled through the hall. Boys studied each other’s faces
questioningly. “He saw you after all!” whispered Dick.
“I don’t see how he could,” whispered Trevor.</p>

<p>“There is a rule,” continued the principal, “forbidding
the keeping of dogs, or any sort of animals, in the academy
buildings.” He paused, and then added grimly: “I will ask
the owner of the animal to stand up.”</p>

<p>There was a flutter of excitement; heads turned expectantly
for sight of the unlucky youth. Silence reigned save
for the whisperings of the boys. But no one arose. The
principal waited calmly, patiently, for several minutes.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said then. “I want every resident
of Masters Hall to come to my office at a quarter of nine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
prompt.” He moved down the steps and the boys flocked
from their seats and hurried out of chapel, laughing, whispering
in the throes of a new sensation. Trevor groaned
as he arose.</p>

<p>“I fancy it would have been better if I’d ’fessed up,”
he said to Dick. “Perhaps he’d have let me off easier.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know. Anyhow, there’s no harm done so
far; you have a right to refuse to incriminate yourself.
Only what he wants us at the office for I can’t see, unless
he’s going to ask each one of us separately. In that case
it’s all up with you.”</p>

<p>“In that case I’ll own up, of course,” said Trevor.
“But it’s rather tough getting into another fuss just when
I’ve got over that stage-coach business. Maybe it’ll be probation
this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” answered Dick as they crossed the
dining-hall. “And it isn’t like Wheels to ask the fellows
to tell on each other; and that’s why I can’t understand
this office business.”</p>

<p>At the appointed time forty-two youths of various ages
and sizes crowded into the principal’s office in Academy
Building. The office consists in reality of two rooms, an
outer and an inner apartment, the first used by the secretary,
the second sacred to Professor Wheeler. The outer
room was crowded when the principal entered, and a gasp
of surprise went up when it was seen that under one arm he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
carried a small, wriggling, greatly excited bull puppy,
which strove earnestly to reach his face with an eager pink
tongue. The principal appeared to appreciate the humor
of his entrance, for there was a slight twitch at the corners
of his mouth, as though he would have liked to smile. At
sight of Muggins Trevor started and made as though to
move forward and claim his property, but Dick laid a warning
hand on his arm, and he kept his place and watched
professor and dog disappear into the inner office. The
forty-two youths—or to be strictly truthful—forty of
them—gazed wonderingly into each other’s faces while
titters of suppressed laughter ran up and down the
ranks. Then the principal came out again still with the
squirming puppy in his arms, and the titters died away
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Are we all here?” he asked. “Supposing you form
into, say, three lines across the room here; that’s it; now I
can count you. Exactly; forty-two; a full attendance, I
see. Kindly give me your attention for a moment.” He
held up the puppy, a squirming white mass of legs, tail, and
pink tongue. “I have here, as you see, a young dog, of
just what breed, age, and previous condition of servitude I
am in doubt. But it has, as you will observe, a collar of
Hillton crimson and a strong steel chain; possibly we shall
be able to identify it by those. Now the owner, or at least
the companion at a late hour last night, of this animal is
known to room in your dormitory. I have called you together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
here in order that he may claim his property. I will
ask him to do so.”</p>

<p>Each boy viewed his neighbor suspiciously, but none
said a word. As before, the principal waited calmly, patiently,
for several moments. Then:</p>

<p>“Very well. You will perhaps recollect the saying in
regard to Mahomet and the mountain. The mountain having
refused to go to Mahomet, Mahomet very sensibly decided
to go to the mountain. In this case, as the owner refuses
to go to the dog, we will see if the dog will go to the
owner.”</p>

<p>Professor deposited the puppy on the floor. Forty-two—or,
to be again truthful, forty—youths viewed the animal
with apprehension. It was all very clever, of course, and
no doubt had a flavor of humor, but—but supposing that
silly dog got it into his head that <em>they</em> were his owner!
How could they prove that they weren’t? How produce
a satisfactory <em>alibi</em>? They stirred uneasily, and frowned at
the puppy.</p>

<p>The puppy, meanwhile, sat down and industriously
scratched his neck.</p>

<p>But after that a spirit of adventure seized him, and he
cast an inquiring glance over the breathless assembly.
Then he moved forward and sniffed tentatively at the
damp boots of Todd, who stood in the middle of the front
line. Todd held his breath and turned pale. But Muggins
evidently didn’t fancy wet leather, for he moved off down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the line, sniffing here and there, but without enthusiasm.
Once he paused and cocked an interrogatory brown eye up
at Williams. And it was Williams’s turn to wish himself
away. He frowned darkly, threateningly, and Muggins,
scenting animosity, turned tail. Williams heaved a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>Muggins now crawled laboriously between the feet of
the next youth, and found himself confronted by a second
rank of motionless, silent, and unsympathetic persons. He
began to feel nervous. He stopped and, pointing his blunt
nose toward heaven, howled long and dismally. Some one
laughed, and the spell of terror was broken. Even Professor
Wheeler smiled, while Muggins, delighted at the evidence
of companionship, wagged his tail and began his
search anew. Dick and Trevor stood, backs to the wall, in
the last of the three lines. Trevor watched the puppy,
scowling ferociously. The suspense was awful. He never
for an instant doubted that sooner or later Nemesis in the
shape of Muggins would find him out. Meanwhile he
frowned, clenched his fists, and waited for his doom. His
doom when it came came speedily.</p>

<p>Muggins had apparently lost interest in the proceedings,
and had begun to whine softly, when suddenly he stopped
dead short, and putting his head aloft, twitched the
wrinkled end of his pink nose and sniffed suspiciously. One
ear went up at an animated angle, and he put his little
bullet-shaped head on one side. Professor Wheeler moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
softly forward to a point where he could better watch
events, and Trevor, after one annihilating glance at the
puppy, stared straight before him. Muggins squirmed
through the second rank, showing signs of strong excitement.
And then—</p>

<p>Then there was a yelp of triumph, of delight, and Muggins
was leaping deliriously at Trevor, giving vent to his
joy in short explosive barks and gurgling yelps.</p>

<p>“I won’t keep you any longer,” said the principal. “If
any of you are late at recitations, you may explain that it
was my fault. I will ask Nesbitt to remain for a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>And with grins of relief and amusement the forty-one
boys crowded forth, leaving Trevor standing there alone,
very red in the face, and with the puppy clasped close in
his arms. Then the principal and Trevor and Muggins adjourned
to the inner room. And there, while Muggins lay
curled contentedly against the boy’s breast—simply because
he couldn’t be induced to stay anywhere else—Trevor,
rather haltingly, explained.</p>

<p>“And you had the dog in your study ever since Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“But how—I can’t understand why no one discovered
it. Didn’t the ‘goody’ see it there?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” And Trevor explained his manner of keeping
that worthy person in ignorance. And once or twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
during the recital, although Trevor really didn’t do the
narrative half justice, the professor concealed his smiles
with difficulty. And then, when there was nothing more
to be said on Trevor’s side, the principal sat silent for several
moments, gazing out of the window. And Trevor
took heart.</p>

<p>“Well, the whole case seems to have been one of sudden
infatuation between a boy and a dog,” said Professor
Wheeler at last, “rather than a preconceived plan to create
mischief or transgress the rules. Under the circumstances——
But, of course, you understand that the dog
can not remain in the grounds?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not, sir.” And the principal smiled at the
lad’s dolorous tones.</p>

<p>“No; now I would suggest that you take him to the
village and find some one there to look after him for you;
I think you can do it; you might try Watson’s stables,
back of the Eagle. Then you can see the dog occasionally,
though you must promise never to bring him onto school
grounds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“And I think that that will be punishment enough for
the case. You may go, Nesbitt. And you may leave the
puppy here, if you like, until you have an opportunity to
go to the village.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, sir,” answered Trevor gratefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“By the way, it’s a bulldog, isn’t it?” asked the principal.
“Yes, I thought so; that head, you know; very intelligent
creature, to be sure.”</p>

<p>And then Trevor placed Muggins on the principal’s big
leather couch, with never a doubt but that that was the
most appropriate place for him, and sneaked to the door.
And when he hurried down the steps of Academy Building,
shrill and faint came to his ears the wailing of Muggins.</p>

<p>After dinner, accompanied by Dick, he conveyed the
puppy to the village and arranged for his board and room—the
latter a comfortable soap-box in the office—at Watson’s
livery-stable. And after a heartrending parting the
two boys returned to the academy and two o’clock recitations.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll be happy there?” asked Trevor
wistfully.</p>

<p>“Sure to be,” Dick assured him. “He’ll be as happy
as—as a bull pup!”</p>

<p>The following afternoon Carl Cray burst excitedly into
the study, where the two were deep in the morrow’s lessons.</p>

<p>“It’s come!” he cried triumphantly. “She’s here!”</p>

<p>“Who’s come?” asked Dick blankly.</p>

<p>“What’s here?” echoed Trevor.</p>

<p>“Why, the ice-yacht—The Sleet!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE VOYAGE OF THE SLEET</small></h2>


<div class="blockquot smfont">

<p><i>The Scene.</i>—The boat-house landing and the river thereabouts.</p>

<p><i>The Time.</i>—Four-thirty of the following Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>—Dick, Trevor, Carl, Stewart, an ice-yacht, chorus of boys
on skates.</p></div>

<p><i>Chorus</i>: “Heave-o! Now, all together! Heave!”</p>

<p><i>Carl</i>: “Hang the thing, anyhow! What’s the matter
with it?”</p>

<p><i>Dick</i>: “Well, since you know all about the art of ice-sailing,
it strikes me that you ought to be able to raise
a little old pillow-sham of a sail like that!”</p>

<p><i>Trevor</i>: “Let’s pull on this rope and see what happens.”</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i>: “How’d you like to be the ice-yachtsmen?”</p>

<p><i>Carl</i>: “That’s the rope! Take hold here, fellows!”</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i>: “Everybody shove!”</p>

<p><i>Carl</i>: “There she goes! Make a hitch there, Dick!
Jump on, quick! <em>Whoa!</em>”</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i>: “A-ah!”</p>

<p>The boat catches the wind, starts suddenly up-stream,
as suddenly changes its mind, veers about, rams the landing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
backs off, charges a group of boys on skates, and then
stands motionless with its head into the wind and laughs
so that its sail flaps.</p>

<p>It is now discovered that there is room on the yacht for
but three fellows at the most, and every one save Carl begs
to be allowed to sacrifice his pleasure and remain at home.
The choice falls to Stewart, and he joins the chorus with
a countenance eloquent of relief. Carl, Dick, and Trevor
huddle together on the cockpit, and a portion of the chorus
shoves the yacht’s head about. The sail fills, and the yacht
glides off up-stream in a strong breeze, to the jeers and
biting sarcasms of the chorus, many of whom pretend to
weep agonizedly into their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>The Sleet had been delivered and paid for the preceding
Wednesday. She was an old-style boat with a length
of sixteen feet and a sail area altogether too small for
her size. A new coat of brilliant—and as yet but partly
dried—crimson paint hid a multitude of weak places.
The cockpit, upholstered with a piece of faded red carpet,
was barely large enough to allow the three boys to huddle
onto it.</p>

<p>The boat-house and landing, Stewart, and the contemptuous
chorus were soon left behind, and The Sleet
gained momentum every second. Carl held the tiller, and
Dick and Trevor held their breaths. The wind was straight
abaft, but the cold made the boys huddle closely together
to protect their faces. The academy buildings faded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sight in the gray afternoon haze, and the river stretched
cold and bleak before them.</p>

<p>“How fast are we going?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; pretty well, I guess,” answered Carl.
“Fine, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dick, doubtfully. “Only I don’t think
we ought to go far away, you know; eh, Trevor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let her rip. What’s the difference whether we
get killed here or farther up? Pull open the throttle,
Carl!”</p>

<p>“Look out for your heads, then; I’m going to swing her
across to the other side.”</p>

<p>Carl moved the tiller to starboard, and the yacht tacked
toward the farther shore at a truly alarming speed.</p>

<p>“She’s going awful fast, Carl,” gasped Dick.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! this is nothing. If there was only a decent
wind——”</p>

<p>“Wow, Carl, she’s keeling over!” yelled Trevor.</p>

<p>The starboard runner was a whole foot above the ice.
The sensation was distinctly unpleasant, and even Carl
seemed not to relish it.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” he muttered. “Oh, yes.” He moved the
tiller cautiously, and the flighty runner settled down upon
the surface once more.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” gasped Dick. “Let’s turn here and
go back, fellows,” he suggested with a fine semblance of
carelessness. Carl grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dick’s scared silly, Trevor,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Well, so’m I,” answered Trevor. “And so are you,
only you won’t let on. The bally thing goes so fast that
it makes you feel funny inside you. But it <em>is</em> fun, Carl.
<em>Look out for the bank!</em>”</p>

<p>Over went the tiller again, and the yacht started on the
starboard tack. The hills on either side were flying past,
and now and then a cluster of houses were seen dimly for
an instant, and then was lost to sight.</p>

<p>“What’s that ahead there?” asked Dick. Carl raised
his eyes and followed the other’s gaze.</p>

<p>“Ice-yacht,” he answered. “Perhaps they’ll race us.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will,” muttered Trevor, “but if you go
any faster when you race, I’ll get off the blooming thing
and walk.”</p>

<p>“Bully boy!” cried Carl. “Feeling better, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I fancy I’ve got some of my breath back, you
know. But I don’t mind saying that I’d rather ride on a
cyclone than this contrivance. And my feet are like snowballs!”</p>

<p>“So are mine,” echoed Dick. “And all the rest of me.
But let’s ask ’em to race, Carl.”</p>

<p>The other yacht, which when first sighted had been a
long distance up the river, was now but a short way ahead,
and was almost motionless, nose into the wind, as though
awaiting the arrival of The Sleet. While the latter boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
was still an eighth of a mile distant a form sprang into view
on the yacht ahead and a hand waved in challenge. Carl
steadied himself on his knees and waved back.</p>

<p>“We’ll race you!” he bawled.</p>

<p>An answering gesture showed that he had been heard,
and the figure disappeared. In another moment the two
yachts were abreast, and the stranger swung about and
took the wind. She had two persons aboard, a man and a
woman, both so wrapped from the weather as to be scarcely
distinguishable. She was a much larger boat than The
Sleet, sloop-rigged, with immaculate white sails and without
side-timbers. She wore no paint, but her woodwork
was varnished until it shone. Altogether there was scarcely
any comparison between the two yachts, so immeasurably
superior was the sloop in every detail.</p>

<p>The Sleet meanwhile had gained an eighth of a mile,
perhaps, ere the stranger had found the wind, but now the
latter came booming after them at a spanking gait, her big
sails as stiff as though frozen. Carl grinned.</p>

<p>“It’ll be a mighty short race, my boys. She can sail
all around this little triangle. But we’ll give her a go, just
the same.” He brought The Sleet closer to the wind, and
then began a series of long tacks that sent the boat fairly
flying over the ice. But the stranger was already at the
same tactics, and ere a mile had passed was abreast of The
Sleet, though at the other side of the river, and her crew
were waving derisively across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if we had as much sail as you have,” growled
Carl, “we might be in your class; as it is, we aren’t. But
The Sleet is a good goer, all the same.”</p>

<p>The other boat stood across into the middle of the river,
and then, as though her former efforts had been but the
merest dawdling, bounded away, and was soon but a small
white speck far up the ice in the haze.</p>

<p>“Let’s turn back now,” suggested Dick. “It must be
getting toward half-past five, and you must remember that
we won’t be able to make as fast time going down the river
as we have coming up.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll turn in a minute.”</p>

<p>And then Carl, whose knowledge of ice-yachting was
derived from the hurried perusal of a library book on the
subject, cudgeled his brains to recollect how to “go about.”
Of course, he might lower the sail and then bring her
around, but that would be a most clumsy, unsportsmanlike
method, and so not to be seriously considered. Presumably,
the thing to do was to luff.</p>

<p>“Stand by to luff!” he bawled. Dick and Trevor
stared.</p>

<p>“Stand!” cried Trevor indignantly. “Why, I can’t
stand, you idiot. It’s all I can do to hold on as it is!”</p>

<p>“Well, look out for the boom, then. I’m going to
bring her about.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Trevor innocently. But he got no answer,
and the next instant he had forgotten his question, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Carl had thrust the helm hard over without first ascertaining
that the sheet was clear. It wasn’t. The result was
startling. The wind struck the sail full, and the yacht swung
violently to port, tilted almost onto her beam ends. Carl
and Trevor went rapidly through space and brought up
on the ice yards and yards away, happily uninjured save
for minor bruises and scratches, and The Sleet, righting
herself, bounded forward with Dick clutching desperately,
dazedly, at the port runner-beam.</p>

<p>When the shock had come Dick, like the others, had
been thrown from the cockpit, but, by good luck or bad,
had encountered the end of the cross-timber, just over the
runner, and had seized it and clung to it with no very clear
idea as to what it was, and not greatly caring. And now,
when he opened his eyes and gazed confusedly about, he
found the yacht ringing merrily over the ice and, judging
by the feeling, kicking up her heels in delight, and found
himself wrapped convulsively about the beam with the wind
whistling madly in his ears and blowing his hair helter-skelter,
for in his flight through air his cap and he had parted
company. He cast a look backward and thought that for
an instant he could discern in the gathering darkness two
figures. Near at hand the stays ran to the masthead, and
he edged himself toward them until he could grasp one in
his numbed fingers. Then he was able to gain the support
of the mast, somewhat painfully, for he found that his
shoulder ached horribly, and that his lip had been cut and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was swelling to disconcerting size. By means of the boom,
which was swinging agitatedly as though constantly meditating
a veer to the other side, he reached the cockpit, and
there, stretched once more at length, he studied the situation.</p>

<p>Apparently, there was no immediate danger; the yacht
was heading fairly straight up the middle of the river, and
although now and then the stern slid this way or that, she
was behaving well. But the imperative thing was to stop.
Dick tried to undo a rope that looked promising, but his
fingers were numb and stiff, despite the woolen gloves that
covered them, and refused to act. He peered ahead into
the descending darkness. The shore to the left was getting
rather too near for comfort, and he seized the tiller, and,
half fearful of the result, swung it to the right, with the
startling result that the yacht headed more directly toward
the threatening shore. Desperately he moved the tiller
to the left, and gave a sigh of relief as the boat’s nose swung
toward midstream. Encouraged by his success he presently
moved the helm back a little, and with the yacht’s head
pointing a middle course, again tried to think of some
means of bringing his unwelcome voyage to an end. He
knew nothing, practically, of yachting on either water or
ice, but he knew that if he could get the sail down the
boat would eventually stop. Painfully he drew off a glove
and sought his pocket-knife. It was not there. He tried all
his pockets with the same disappointing result. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
drew his glove back over his deadened hand, and thought
desperately of jumping off and letting The Sleet look after
herself. But the prospect of being dashed across the ice
at the risk of a broken limb didn’t appeal to him; and besides,
he felt in a measure responsible for the safe return
of the confounded boat.</p>

<p><a href="#image05">“Stand by the ship!” he muttered</a> with an attempt at
a grin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<a name="image05" id="image05">
  <img src="images/image05.jpg" width="410" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_132">“Stand by the ship!” he muttered.</a></div>
</div>

<p>The wind seemed now to be decreasing in force, but The
Sleet still charged away into the gathering blackness with
breathless speed. At a loss for any better solution, Dick
struggled again at the rope, and it seemed that success was
about to reward his efforts when there was a sudden jar, followed
a second later by a strange sinking sensation, the
sound of breaking ice, and then Dick felt the cockpit being
lifted up and up, and ere he could grasp anything he was
rolled over the edge and plunged downward into icy water.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>DICK TELLS HIS STORY</small></h2>


<p>When Carl and Trevor, bruised and breathless, found
their feet and stared about them, The Sleet was already a
whisking gray blot in the twilight. Trevor obeyed his first
impulse and limping up the ice in the direction of the disappearing
boat, called frantically: “Dick! Dick!” Then,
realizing the absurdity of his chase after a thing that was
probably reeling off half a mile every minute or so, he
stopped and came dejectedly back to where Carl was silently
rubbing a bruised thigh.</p>

<p>“Dick will be killed!” he cried hoarsely. “What shall
we do?”</p>

<p>“Get back to the academy,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“What good will that do?”</p>

<p>“They can telegraph up the river and get some one to
look for him. I wonder how far from Hillton we are?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Trevor, “but let’s hurry.
Which way shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Across the river to the railroad track. Maybe, Trevor,
there’s a station between here and Hillton; there ought to
be, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” sorrowed his companion. “Do you
think Dick might have dropped off after we saw him?
Maybe, Carl, he’s lying up there on the ice somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. I think Dick will hold on as long
as he can. Perhaps he will manage to get back onto the
boat; if he does he ought to be able to stop her; he knows
enough to lower the sail, I guess. I dare say he’ll turn up
all right before long. The best thing for us to do is to
find a telegraph office as soon as we can. Come ahead.”</p>

<p>Somewhat comforted, Trevor limped along and the two
gained the river bank and stumbled through the darkness
to the railroad track. Down this they tramped, silent for
the most part, with feet that had no feeling left in them,
and with fingers that ached terribly. How far from the
academy they were neither had any idea; perhaps ten miles,
perhaps less. As for the time, that at least they knew, for
Trevor managed to get his watch out and Carl supplied a
match; the hands pointed to twenty minutes of six.</p>

<p>“We ought to be home by seven,” said Carl with attempted
cheerfulness. Trevor groaned.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed; a half. It was too dark
to recognize anything save the lines of track, which had
left the river some distance to the right. Suddenly a slight
turn brought into view a cluster of lights, white and green.</p>

<p>“A station!” cried Trevor.</p>

<p>The two boys increased their gait and five minutes later
passed a freight train on a siding, and found a little box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of a station, ablaze with light, and oh, how warm! Around
a great whitewashed stove in the middle of the waiting-room
sat three men. Two had woolen caps on; the third
was bareheaded, and him the boys rightly judged to be the
station-master. Their story was quickly told, and a moment
later the key at the telegraph desk was ticking off messages
to stations up the line.</p>

<p>“You must have got thrown out at about Whitely
Mills,” said one of the men at the stove. “The boat would
have a clear track from there up to—— I say, Gus,” he
called suddenly to the man at the instrument, “they were
cutting ice to-day at the houses just this side of Lorraine.
That would be a bad part of the river to get onto in the
dark. You’d better tell the fellow at Lorraine to send some
one down there with a lantern; what d’ye think, Joe?”</p>

<p>The third man nodded his head. “Bad place; I noticed
they were cutting pretty well out toward the channel.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the station-master. And the instrument
ticked on. Carl and Trevor sat by the stove and
held their feet and hands to the grateful warmth. They
were too tired, too dejected to talk. The engineer and
conductor of the waiting freight eyed them curiously but
kindly. Finally the latter asked:</p>

<p>“How you boys going to get to Hillton?”</p>

<p>“Walk,” answered Carl with a faint smile. “How
far is it from here?”</p>

<p>“Twelve miles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The two lads looked at each other and groaned.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care so much, now that I’ve got thawed
out a bit,” said Trevor. “How far do you think we have
walked?”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s about three miles from Whitely here.”</p>

<p>“At that rate,” commented Carl dismally, “it will take
us two hours longer to reach Hillton. And”—he glanced
at the station clock—“it’s now twenty after six; say half-past
eight.” The engineer and conductor were exchanging
glances of amusement. Finally the conductor spoke again:</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we can fix it so as you won’t have to
walk. The through freight will be here in seven minutes,
and I guess they’ll give you a lift. If they don’t you can
ride down with us, although we won’t get there much before
seven. We’re slow but sure, we are; twenty-eight cars
of coal and a caboose.”</p>

<p>The boys brightened and thanked the railroad men
fervently. And then the station-master left the telegraph
instrument and came out into the waiting-room.</p>

<p>“It’s all right. I’ve put ’em on as far north as Yorkvale,
and if he’s still on the yacht they’ll find him, I guess.”
He turned to the conductor and added in lower tones:
“Gregson, at Lorraine, says he’ll see that a party goes
down right away; says he doesn’t believe a yacht could pass
there to-night, as the river hasn’t had time to freeze much
since they quit cutting at about four.”</p>

<p>The conductor nodded. From far off came the long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
shrill blast of a locomotive whistle, and the men drew on
their coats, and presently, followed closely by Carl and
Trevor, left the station.</p>

<p>There was a flood of yellow light on the rails to the
north, and the next instant the fast freight thundered by
them for half its length, the brake shoes rasping deafeningly
against the wheels. The matter was soon arranged,
and Trevor and Carl found themselves sitting in the strange
little caboose about a tiny stove that was almost red-hot,
and telling their story to two of the train crew. And then,
almost before they knew that they had got well started,
the train slowed down, and they were tumbled out into the
snow at the Hillton crossing, and, shouting their thanks after
the scurrying car as it romped off again into the darkness,
they took up the last stage of their journey. But now, aside
from the anxiety they felt as to Dick’s fate, they were fairly
comfortable and contented; and the prospect of supper—for
it seemed to them that never before in the history of the
world had two persons been so hungry—allowed them to
view their coming interview with the principal with something
approaching equanimity.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Professor Beck was speeding northward
in a buggy behind the fastest horse in Watson’s
stables, and Trevor and Carl, subdued and anxious, were
eating as though their lives depended upon it in the deserted
dining-hall. And afterward Trevor donned his ridiculous
red dressing-gown and sat in front of the study fire for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hours, listening anxiously for sounds on the stairs that
would tell of Dick’s safe return. Sleep, despite his best
endeavors, besieged him constantly, and now and then he
dropped off for a minute or two, only to reawake with a
start and rub his smarting eyes confusedly.</p>

<p>“I wish Muggins was here,” he sighed. “It wouldn’t
be so lonely.” Then the clock gathered its hands together
at the figure XII, and Trevor crept sleepily but protestingly
to bed and dropped into heavy slumber the moment
his head touched the pillow.</p>

<p>Once—it seemed as though it must be almost daylight—there
were disturbing sounds in the bedroom, and Trevor
turned over with a groan, and, even while he was asking
himself what the noise meant, went off to slumber again.
When he awoke in the morning, and the happenings of the
previous evening rushed back to memory, he sat up suddenly
with a wild, anxious look toward the neighboring
bed, and a deep sigh of relief and joy escaped him. For
Dick’s tumbled head lay on the pillow, and Dick’s hearty
snores made music in his ears.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the crew of The Sleet, including Stewart,
were gathered about the hearth in Number 16, listening
breathlessly to Dick’s narrative.</p>

<p>“My, but that water was cold!” Dick was saying.
“And deep, too. It seemed as though I never would stop
going down. You see, I was so surprised that I just let
myself go, and never thought of struggling for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
while. When I did, it took me so long to reach the surface
again that I hadn’t any breath left in my body. I
got hold of the edge of the ice and tried to pull myself out,
but it was only about half an inch thick, I guess, and broke
right off every time, and down I’d go again, over my head,
maybe. Finally I stopped that and managed to keep my
head out. It was as dark as Egypt by that time, but after
awhile I caught sight of The Sleet just a few yards away,
sticking up into the air like a big triangle. It was on its
side with one runner ’way under the water. Farther off I
could make out three black hulks of things that I concluded
were ice-houses, and Professor Beck says that’s what
they were. Of course, when I saw the yacht I knew that
I was all right; all I had to do was to keep on breaking the
ice until I reached it. But I was so plaguy cold, and my
teeth were chattering so, and my clothing was so heavy that
it wasn’t very easy after all. But after a while I found
something that wasn’t ice; it was the sail, and it was lying
flat over the water and broken ice. It sagged down with
me after I managed to get onto it, but held me all right,
and I crawled along it until I reached the—the—what do
you call it, Carl?”</p>

<p>“Boom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, boom. And then I got onto the mast and leaned
against a plank—the cross-plank, it was—and I was all
right, except that I was almost dead with the cold, and was
afraid I’d freeze to death. So I kept stamping around and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
throwing my arms about as well as I could without falling
into the water again, and after a while I got comparatively
warmed up. Then—I suppose I’d been there fifteen or
twenty minutes—I began to wonder if I couldn’t get off.
You see, I argued that the yacht would have broken
through just as soon as the ice became thin, and so it seemed
to me that there must be thick ice just back of the boat.
But, try as I might, I couldn’t for the life of me decide
which was the back of the silly thing and which the front.
And I was afraid that I’d go plumping into that beastly
cold water again. But after a while I got up my pluck and
went to feeling about, letting myself down here and there,
and crawling around. But every time I’d try to stand on
the ice, down I’d go; and so finally I gave it up. But the
climbing about kept me warmed up after a fashion; I dare
say I was as warm as a fellow could be with his clothes
sopping wet where they weren’t frozen stiff. So I crawled
back to the mast again and set out to holler.</p>

<p>“I wish you could have heard me! I yelled in forty
different styles. And when I couldn’t think of anything
else I cheered; cheered for Hilton, cheered for The Sleet,
cheered for the ice-houses, and incidentally, my young
friends, cheered myself. And then my voice and my breath
gave out, and I stood still a while and kicked my frozen
feet against the plank and thought about fires and cups of
hot coffee and things to eat until I was nearly crazy. And
then I saw some lights flickering away off in the distance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the right of the ice-houses, and began yelling again. And
that’s about all. There were three fellows with lanterns
and they got a piece of plank or something and took me
off. And what do you think?” he asked disgustedly.
“There was thick ice, half a foot thick, within three feet
of me all the time!</p>

<p>“A man who said he was the station-master took me
up to a house, and they gave me some blankets and things
and dried my clothes and poured hot coffee and brandy
stuff into me, and I went to sleep for a while in front of a
big round stove; and was never so happy in my life. Afterward
I ate some supper; my, fellows, but it was good! And
then, in about an hour or so, Professor Beck popped in and
said that he didn’t want to hurry me, but that if I’d quite
finished bathing we’d go home. The station fellow—I believe
I’ve forgotten his name—said he’d attend to having
the ice-yacht hauled out for us, and would look after it
until we sent for it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s much broken up?” asked Carl.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Dick vigorously, “and what’s
more, I don’t care a continental!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Sleet, to anticipate a trifle, went back to its former
owner at a loss to the shareholders of six dollars, and a
faculty edict was solemnly published prohibiting forevermore
at Hillton Academy the fascinating and exhilarating
sport of ice-yachting.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>IN THE ROWING-ROOM</small></h2>


<p>February came in at Hillton as though resolved to
make up for its brevity by strict attention to business, and
dealt out snow and sleet with a lavish hand, and bullied
the elements, which had begun to show signs of relenting,
into a state of sullen ferocity. For days together the sun
never so much as showed its face through the leaden clouds,
and the winds howled spitefully across the yard. It was the
sort of weather which, as Trevor explained one afternoon,
while staring dolorously out the window, fairly drove a
fellow to study. The river retained its armor of glaring
ice, and the white-winged yachts passed and repassed continuously,
without, however, eliciting anything but the most
grudging admiration from Dick. The hockey team went to
Marshall and triumphed decisively over St. Eustace, who,
minus Jenkins and the freckle-faced Billings, was shorn
of her strength. And, as though that was not glory enough,
Hillton and her old rival met in debate in the town hall
at Hillton and the former won a fourth consecutive victory
by proving to the satisfaction of three staid and reverend
judges that the development of the arid West would prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of more benefit to the United States than the construction
of an isthmian canal.</p>

<p>Work in the cage had begun for the baseball candidates,
and Carl Gray was very busy. Ambitious youths who were
striving for places on the track team held forth three afternoons
each week in the gymnasium, and a spirit of athletism
seized upon the school world. The first squad of crew
candidates had graduated from weights to machines, while
the second squad, swelled by eight recruits since its first
assembling, were still in the throes of preliminary training.
Professor Beck had “hooked” the promising upper
middle boy of whom he had spoken to Dick; several candidates,
inclusive of the unfortunate Perry, had been
dropped, and Coach Kirk had paid his first visit to the
academy, had looked the fellows over undemonstratively, and
had gone his way again. To-day, a bleak and dismal Thursday,
the machines were occupied, and Professor Beck was
watching the performances of the eight youths with dissatisfied
mien.</p>

<p>“Lengthen out, Waters, lengthen out; that’s better.
Crocker, your recovery’s too slow; put some ginger into it;
this is no place to go to sleep. Four, put more drive into
your legs; that’s the way. Stroke, hit it up a little!” And
Dick, in obedience to the command, quickened his stroke.
When the rest had gone Beck turned to Dick: “Hope,
what’s the matter with Taylor? This is the third day he’s
been absent. We can’t have that. You must speak to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
him, and tell him that he’ll have to attend to business
better.”</p>

<p>And Dick promised and went off laggingly to the task.
He found Taylor in his room in a boarding-house in the
village.</p>

<p>He was stretched out on a couch reading when Dick
entered in response to a loud “Come in.” He appeared
surprised when he looked up and saw who his visitor was,
but rose to the demands of the occasion.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hope, glad to see you. Sit down. Been ice-yachting
lately?”</p>

<p>Dick replied gravely that he had not, and then heroically
plunged into the subject of his visit.</p>

<p>“Look here, Taylor,” he said, “I wish you’d try to be
a little more careful about training. You missed work
again to-day. This makes the third time it’s happened in
the last two weeks. Can’t you do better than that?”</p>

<p>Taylor frowned and yawned lazily before he answered.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve mentioned it, Hope. The fact is, I’ve
been thinking about chucking it. I can’t see how I’m going
to go in for rowing this year and hope to pass spring
exams. That’s what the trouble is, old chap. I’ve been
digging hard all afternoon”—adding, as he saw Dick
glance at the magazine in his hands—“just this minute laid
my Greek aside and took up this to—er—ease my brain.”
He stopped and smiled amiably across.</p>

<p>Dick frowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s nonsense, Taylor, and you know it,” he said in
low tones.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Taylor raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, nonsense. You can’t convince me that you’re so
stupid as not to be able to train for the crew and get
through with your studies. There are lots of fellows doing
it; always have done it. I’m doing it myself; Crocker’s
doing it; so’s Milton and Arnold and lots of fellows; they’re
all in in our class; I haven’t heard them say that they were
afraid of not passing.”</p>

<p>“Well, that may be,” replied Taylor, “but it’s a question
that every fellow must decide for himself. I honestly
don’t think I ought to keep up crew work; I’ve got
my folks to think of, you know; they didn’t send me to
school here to row or play football or anything of that
sort—that is, not that alone. I’ve got to pass, and to do
that I’ve got to study. If I’m not as smart and clever
as some of the rest of you”—here there was a trace of a
sneer—“I can’t help it; a fellow’s what he is, you know.”</p>

<p>Dick experienced an intense desire to kick his host and
tell him what he thought of him. But instead he smiled
conciliatingly.</p>

<p>“I think you’re underestimating your ability, Taylor.
Like a good fellow, get those notions out of your head and
come back to work; do your best for the crew; it’s your last
year. You know what shape we’re in; we haven’t anywhere
near the material we ought to have. Confound it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Taylor, you’ve got to stay in the boat! You can’t do anything
else, when you stop and think how your leaving will
weaken us!”</p>

<p>A smile of pleased vanity crossed the other boy’s face.
Then he shook his head resolutely.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t do it, Hope. Oh, I’ve thought it all over,
and I know what it means to the crew; but you’ll soon find
another fellow at seven, and never miss me. Of course, I’m
awful sorry if it’s going to make trouble for you, Hope;
you know that. But it’s my duty, and I guess we’d better
consider the matter settled. I”—he smiled apologetically—“I’ll
tender my resignation, Hope.”</p>

<p>Dick arose, striving to conceal the indignation he felt.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t accept it to-day, Taylor,” he answered
gravely. “If you feel the same way about it to-morrow
evening, after thinking it over, send me word and then
I’ll scratch your name off the list. Only I hope you’ll see
your way to stay in the boat.”</p>

<p>On the way back to the academy Dick gave vent to
his feelings, creasing his brows savagely, kicking right and
left at inoffending lumps of ice, and even muttering half
aloud as he strode along.</p>

<p>“Of all mean, contemptible tricks,” he thought angrily,
“that’s the worst! Just to spite me he’s willing to
see the school defeated! By Jove, I have half a mind to
put the whole affair before Beck and Wheeler; the whole
school ought to know it. If they did, Taylor’s life wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
be worth living! But, no, I can’t shove it off on any one
else; I’m captain; I’ve got to fight it out alone; and I
will! And I’ll turn out a decent crew in spite of Taylor,
in spite of anything he can do, by Jove! I’ll——”</p>

<p>“’Ware the dog!” cried a voice, and he looked up
quickly to see Trevor grinning at him and to find Muggins
leaping about him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Muggs!” he cried, vainly striving to bestow
a pat upon that unquiet animal. “Say, Trevor, hasn’t he
grown? He’s twice the size he was when you got him!”</p>

<p>“It’s a way puppies have.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so? Who’d have thunk it! Beastly
cold, isn’t it? Where you going?”</p>

<p>“You can ask a lot of questions for a small kid,”
laughed Trevor. “I’m going to take Muggins back to his
soap-box, and then I’m going home. We’ve been out for a
nice long walk, haven’t we, Muggins? Where’ve you
been?”</p>

<p>“Paying an afternoon call on Roy Taylor. Come on,
I’ll walk back to the stable with you.”</p>

<p>“All right; come ahead, Muggins. Now, behave yourself
nicely before your Uncle Richard! Hope Taylor was
glad to see you?”</p>

<p>“I guess he was. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t be so bally secretive about it,”
grinned Trevor. “Don’t you think I know that you went
to call him down for not showing up to-day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“You seem to know a good deal,” answered Dick, noncommittingly.</p>

<p>Trevor nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>“I do; I’m what you fellows call ‘right smart.’ I hope
you gave it to him straight from the shoulder.” And after
a pause, in a sudden burst of enthusiasm, “I don’t like that
chap a little bit!”</p>

<p>“I gathered as much,” laughed Dick. “Beck was
pretty huffy at him this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder. Just fancy, the beggar doesn’t show
up half the time, while the rest of us poor dubs sit there
and slave at those bally machines until our arms are pulled
out of shape. I know mine are at least six inches longer
than they were a month ago.”</p>

<p>“How did you get on to-day?”</p>

<p>“Fairly well, I fancy. Only it takes a long time to get
used to your style of rowing. You see, it’s rather different
from ours.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Perhaps you’re not aware that we are supposed
to row the English stroke?” Trevor raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“The dickens you say? Well, I can’t see much resemblance,
Dick. Why, you haven’t any body-swing; you make
a chap’s legs do it all!”</p>

<p>“Do we? Well, you must mention that to Kirk next
Saturday; I dare say he’ll be glad to hear about it.”</p>

<p>“Rot; I’m not finding fault; any old stroke will do me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I’m just saying that there’s a difference between the stroke
that Beck and you teach and the English stroke that I’ve
seen. Maybe yours is the better of the two. Here we are,
Muggins. Now, be a good doggy until I see you again;
and don’t pull any more blankets off the table, or Jim
will lay it onto you with a strap.”</p>

<p>Muggins had by this time grown inured to partings,
and so only stood by the office stove and watched them disappear
with head on one side and a sort of “Must you
go?” expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>“When do we get onto the river?” asked Trevor presently
as they retraced their steps down the village street in
the teeth of a northwest gale.</p>

<p>“Depends; sometimes in early March, sometimes not
until about April. You see, the ice makes it awkward.
Kirk has got it into his head that we’ll get out early this
spring; I don’t know whether he’s made any arrangements
with the weather man.”</p>

<p>“He’s older than I expected. Last year I was a bit surprised
to see what a staid and venerable party he was.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s nearly forty, though I don’t suppose that’s
exactly old—when you get used to it; they get even older,
I’m told. But Kirk knows a good deal about rowing, and
he has turned out some dandy crews, both here and at Harwell.
When he was at school here he was captain of the
eight in his upper middle and senior years, and at college
he rowed four in his class crew the first year, went into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
varsity boat the next, and stayed there until he graduated;
he was captain in his senior year. Then he coached them
for a while. This is his fourth year with us, and we’ve
beaten St. Eustace twice and been beaten once in that time;
and we’ll beat her again next June.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Trevor, “only I can’t see why every
one seems so half-hearted about it. I don’t mean you or
Beck,” he explained hurriedly, “but the fellows as a rule;
they don’t seem to care much about it.”</p>

<p>“I know; but part of that is just—just put on, assumed,
Trevor; when the crews get on the water it will be different.
But, just the same,” he owned sorrowfully, “there is an
unusual lack of rowing spirit among the fellows this year.
I dare say it will happen that way now and then. Only I
wish it hadn’t happened this year,” he added ruefully.</p>

<p>“So do I, for your sake, old chap,” answered Trevor
heartily as they climbed to their room.</p>

<p>The head coach put in his appearance on the following
Saturday afternoon, despite a heavy snow-storm that well-nigh
blocked the roads, and by his brisk, businesslike manners
put new life into the first squad, for the moment at
least. Malcolm Kirk was a man of medium height, approaching
forty years of age, with a good but not exaggerated
breadth of chest and shoulder, and very serious
and steady black eyes. His manner was usually contained
and rather grave, and he possessed a widely noted habit
of keeping his own mind and every one else’s fixed firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
for the time on the matter in hand, to the exclusion of
all else.</p>

<p>As an example of this, it was told of him that once,
while coaching a college crew in a barge, he was lecturing
a man in the waist on the subject of dropping the hands,
when the barge struck a snag which ripped a hole in her.
“You don’t get your oar out of the water clean, Four,”
remonstrated the coach. “Drop the forearm as well as the
hands.” The barge was by this time awash. “We’ve
ripped a hole in the skin, sir,” called the coxswain. “Eh?
Very careless,” answered the coach from the bow of the
launch. “There, Four, that’s better. Now make your
wrist turn sharper. Keep it up, keep it up; you’re doing
better!” And the eight rowed the half-filled barge an
eighth of a mile before Kirk was quite satisfied with
the unfortunate Four’s work, and allowed the men to
come out.</p>

<p>To-day the first thing he noted was the presence of a
new fellow at seven.</p>

<p>“Where’s that man Taylor?” he asked of Dick.</p>

<p>“He’s stopped training, Mr. Kirk; says he can’t keep up
with his studies.” Kirk stared.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, we must have him back; tell him so, Hope.
Now, Six, that won’t do; don’t meet the oar that way, take
it back to you; finish hard and full. Bow, you begin to
slide forward too soon; start your swing first and let it carry
the slide with it. Three, you’re doing better to-day. Keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the leg-power up to the last moment; knees down firm at
the end of the stroke.” And Trevor, tugging heroically,
hears, and begins to think that perhaps he <em>will</em> learn the
stroke eventually, after all!</p>

<p>When work was over Kirk again brought up the subject
of Taylor. “Yes, we must have him back, Hope; tell
him so; make him understand that it’s necessary. He’s a
good oar; fits into his place well; has lots of weight where
he needs it.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he won’t come back,” answered Dick.
“He’s got it into his head that he can’t go in for rowing
and pass his exams.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! never mind what he’s got into his head; tell
him we need him in the boat; make him understand that
it’s his duty, Hope. And I tell you we <em>do</em> need him, my
boy; never saw such an unpromising lot of fellows at Hillton.
That man you had at seven to-day couldn’t fill the
place in the boat; he’s too light; don’t think he has the
grit for it, even if he learned to put some power into his
stroke, which he doesn’t at present. You’ve got a good man
at bow; what’s his name? Shield? Well, he’s promising.
And Three, I like Three’s looks; seems to be in earnest,
though he has a deuce of a queer way of throwing his body
around the boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s Nesbitt,” explained Dick. “He’s English, and
has rowed some at home; I believe he finds our stroke
rather difficult; but I think he’ll do well; he’s my roommate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and I know that he’s the sort of fellow that’ll keep
on trying until he gets what he’s after.”</p>

<p>Kirk nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder. English, eh? That explains that
body-swing of his, I suppose. Well, I guess he’ll turn out
well, though I believe he’ll do better at four when we
get into the water. Now, I’ll have a look at the other
squad.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for Kirk to talk about making
Taylor come back,” said Dick to himself that evening, “but
I wish he had it to do. However, I suppose I’ll have to
make a stab at it. But I’d rather have a tooth pulled. We
do need him, though, and that’s a fact, and what I’ve got
to do is forget what I like and don’t like, and work for the
crew. I’ll go around and see him to-morrow. No, by
Jove, I’ll go to-night; there’s no time like the present for
anything disagreeable!” And he jumped up, threw aside
his book, and began to struggle into his coat. Trevor
glanced up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Over to the village to see Taylor.”</p>

<p>“Phew! what a growl; want me to go along?”</p>

<p>“No, not unless you want to sit on the steps and wait
for me; I’ve got to see him about something private.”</p>

<p>Trevor grinned.</p>

<p>“Fancy, now! Honest, Dick, if you’re going to punch
his head, I’d like blooming well to help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“I dare say,” laughed his roommate, “but I’m not
going to punch his head. Coming along?”</p>

<p>“And sit on the front doorstep in this weather and
twiddle my thumbs? I fancy not, my dear. As the vulgar
manner of speech hath it, ‘Guess again!’” And Trevor
snuggled up ostentatiously to the warmth of the blaze. But
after Dick had taken his departure he laid down his book
and eyed the flames thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I rather wish I had gone along,” he muttered. “It’s
just possible that he is going to punch Taylor, after all.”</p>

<small><a href="#image06">A DECLARATION OF WAR</a></small></h2>


<p>Dick was lucky enough to find Roy Taylor at home,
huddled close to the fireplace, and evidently busy with his
studies. His welcome to-night was less suave than on the
occasion of Dick’s previous visit. His greeting was almost
impolite, and Dick, who on his way from the yard had
resolved to keep his temper no matter what happened,
already felt his anger rising.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">

</div>

<p>“I came to see you about crew work, Taylor,” he began.
“In the first place we need you in the boat; in the
second place we’ve got to have you.”</p>

<p>“My dear chap——” began Taylor in bored tones.</p>

<p>“No, wait a minute,” interrupted Dick. “Let me
have my say. You’ve left us in a hole. It would have been
better if you hadn’t started training at all; better than
letting me think you were going to row and then backing
down in this way; as I say, it leaves us in a hole. Besides
that, it’s not—not patriotic. You know what a hard time
we’ve got ahead of us; you know that we’ve got to have
good material if we are to win out from St. Eustace; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
you know that when you cut rowing you’re doing about all
in your power to get us beaten.”</p>

<p>Taylor flushed angrily.</p>

<p>“That’s tommyrot!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t; it’s the truth; you know it is, Taylor.
And you know very well that if the fellows learned it you
couldn’t stay here.”</p>

<p>“Well, on my word!” ejaculated Taylor; “you’ve got
a lot of cheek to sit there and—and throw insults at me.
You must be crazy!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so; and I’m not insulting you, at least
not intentionally. But I am telling what’s so. You’ve
taken about the meanest course in the matter you could,
and all the school would say so if they knew.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s a threat,” sneered Taylor.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t. I have no intention——”</p>

<p>“But let me tell you that I don’t care a fig for all your
nasty insinuations, Hope; you can tell all the lies about
me you want to. I don’t believe that the fellows will call
it dishonest for a chap to give up crew work because he
finds that he can’t do justice to his studies; I don’t believe
that they will call it mean. I tell you, Hope, you crew and
football and baseball beggars have got a false notion of
school life; you think that all a chap comes here for is to
row in your dirty old boat, or mess round with a football;
that study is a secondary consideration. But it’s not that
way, by ginger; no, sir; that’s where you are off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s nonsense,” replied Dick calmly. “And you
know well enough that I don’t think any such thing, nor
do any of the fellows here. What I do think is that the
average fellow can do his studies and take part in sports
and be all the better for it. Look at the Honor Men of
last year; look——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a fig for the Honor Men of last year.
What I say——”</p>

<p>“Taylor, when you tell me that you’ve chucked rowing
because you can’t keep up with your studies you’re saying
what isn’t so,” cried Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Taylor glared with an ugly expression in his
eyes. “Oh, is that so? Maybe you know all about my
affairs—better than I do, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“I know that much,” answered Dick, striving to speak
calmly. “I know that the reason you’ve left the crew is
because you want to do all you can to prevent me from
turning out a winning eight. And I know you want to
do that because you have a grudge against me for beating
you last spring for the captaincy. I know that much, Taylor,
and I want you to know that I know it. We might
as well understand each other right here and now.”</p>

<p>Taylor’s snarl died away, and he grinned mockingly
across at Dick.</p>

<p>“All right, my smart friend. Supposing that is so?
Mind, I don’t say that it is so; but supposing it is, what
are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick hesitated for an instant and the grin on Taylor’s
face widened as he saw it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re going to tell that yarn to the fellows?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Dick; “I’ve thought of that, but I’m
no tell-tale; and, besides, it wouldn’t do any good. It might
make things unpleasant for you——”</p>

<p>“If any one believed it,” sneered Taylor.</p>

<p>“But it wouldn’t better the crew any. And that’s
all I care about, Taylor. I’m captain this year, and I’m
going to turn out a good crew; I’m going to do it in spite
of you or anything you can do!”</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me, you ought to go into melodrama,
Hope; you’d make a hit, really you would.” Then his manner
changed suddenly, and he leaned forward toward the
other, scowling darkly. “Look here, I don’t mind telling
the truth, Hope, to you; I’m not afraid of anything you
can do. You’re right about the captaincy; you’re right
about the grudge, if you care to call it that. Let me tell
you: This is my last year here. I’m not going up to college
like you; I mean a college where they have rowing;
I’m going to Tech. Ever since I came here I’ve wanted
to be captain—for one year if no more; that’s been my—my
ambition, if you like; I’d set my heart on it. I went
into rowing when I was a junior; made a place. The next
year I went into the varsity boat. The next year I hoped
to be captain, but I missed it; Brown won it, hang him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Last spring I thought I had it at last; there was no reason
why I shouldn’t have had it; I’m a good oar, as good as
there was in the last year’s varsity; I’m old enough; and
I’m a senior. But no, you had to spoil it; you were popular
with the crew, more popular than I was; and you
had Beck with you. If it hadn’t been for Beck I’d have
made it, I know; but he wanted you to have it.”</p>

<p>“Beck had no part in the election,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“He didn’t attend it and he had no vote, but don’t you
suppose the fellows knew what he wanted? Of course they
did; they were willing to please Beck; and so they chose
you captain. And that’s why I’ve no love for you. I’ve
worked all the fall and all the winter, so far, to keep the
fellows from joining the crews; and I’ve succeeded, too;
and I’m going to keep on unless——” He paused and
dropped his gaze from Dick’s face for an instant.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Dick, with traces of wonderment in his
voice. “But what—what does it all lead to? You may
bring defeat to Hillton, but how will that better things?
You wanted the captaincy; I can understand that; I—I
think I’m sorry you were disappointed——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” growled Taylor.</p>

<p>“But it’s too late now, isn’t it? Haven’t you made
trouble enough? As far as I’m concerned personally I
don’t care a row of buttons whether you have it in for
me or not, but what’s the use in taking your spite out
on the whole school?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe it isn’t too late,” answered Taylor, smiling
oddly. “You see, I know pretty well what sort of a chap
you are; you’re one of those conscientious dubs; you’d do
all kinds of stunts and be tickled to death if you thought
you were helping the school. And you’re honest all
through; if you lied to any one—even yourself—you’d go
off into a corner somewhere and throw a fit! I’ve taken all
that into consideration.”</p>

<p>“Drop that,” said Dick stiffly, “and say what you
mean.”</p>

<p>“All right. Look here; do you want Hillton to win the
race? Very well; and do you think she can do it with the
material she’s got now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no you don’t; and if you do you’re mightily mistaken.
I said a while ago that you’d find a man for my
place at seven, but you won’t; there isn’t one to be found;
there isn’t a fellow that’s heavy enough for it. I know;
I’ve watched what’s going on, and I know who you’ve got.
And you’ll lose other men before long; I’ve fixed that.
Now, listen; there’s just one way you can turn out a crew
that will run away from St. Eustace: that’s by getting me
back into the boat, keeping all the experienced fellows
you’ve got, and getting one or two good men that will only
go in for crew work when I ask them to.”</p>

<p>Taylor paused and smiled triumphantly. Dick clenched
his hands, fighting down an almost overpowering impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to leap across the width of the hearth, and—yes, as Trevor
had suggested—punch Taylor’s head!</p>

<p>“That makes you mad, eh?” grinned his host.</p>

<p>“What are you driving at?” cried Dick angrily. “If
you’ve got anything to say, say it and get done.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got an offer to make,” replied Taylor
softly. “I’ll go back to work and bring three, possibly
four, good fellows with me, and do all I can for the success
of the crew, if——”</p>

<p>“If what?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll resign from the captaincy.”</p>

<p>Dick stared at the other for a moment in speechless
amaze. For the first time a full understanding of Taylor’s
conspiracy came to him; but even then he could scarcely
believe that the other was in earnest.</p>

<p>“But—how would that help you?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“I should get the captaincy, because according to the
bargain you would promise to do all you could to help me
get it. Well, what do you say?”</p>

<p>Dick jumped up and stared angrily at the other’s smiling,
imperturbable face.</p>

<p>“I say no! I say you’re a mean, contemptible scoundrel,
Taylor. And I’ve heard enough; you make me sick!”
He buttoned his coat with fingers that trembled despite him,
and strode to the door. Taylor’s face was flushed, and he
arose and took a step after him. Then he stopped and,
seemingly with an effort, laughed harshly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought you’d refuse at first,” he said. “There’s
no hurry; think it over. You’ll consent in the end because”—he
raised his voice, for Dick was already in the
hall—“because it’s the only way you can make sure of
success for the crew.”</p>

<p>Dick strode down the stairs without replying, and
plunged into the darkness toward the academy, striding
along as though shod in seven-league boots, in an unconscious
effort to escape from the fury that possessed him.
At the gate leading into the yard he paused breathlessly,
looked about him, and laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“And I started out with the resolve to keep my temper!”
he sighed.</p>

<p>As he reached the head of the stairs the sound of a
voice, even-toned, monotonous, met his ears, and as he approached
Number 16 he discovered that it issued from
that study. He paused outside the door and listened; Trevor
was apparently translating aloud:</p>

<p>“‘The hippopotamus is esteemed sacred in the Papremis
district, but in no other part of Egypt. I shall
describe its nature and properties. It has four feet, which
are cloven—like the devil’s—or like an ox’s; the nose is
short and tip-tilted—like Trevor Nesbitt’s—and the teeth
are prominent—like Professor Sharp’s; it resembles a horse
in its mane——’”</p>

<p>“Excellent, Nesbitt, excellent,” said a deep voice, for
all the world like Professor Garrison’s. “Hence, gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
we have the saying ‘Remember the Mane.’ Proceed,
Nesbitt.”</p>

<p>“‘It resembles a horse in its mane, its tail, and its
voice; it is of the size of a big ox, and has an epidermis—otherwise,
and in vulgar parlance, a skin—so remarkably
thick that when dry it becomes very offensive.’” The
monotonous voice paused; apparently the rendering of the
latter portion of the narrative was not quite satisfactory.
But the second occupant of the study was evidently lenient,
for the deep voice said:</p>

<p>“Proceed, Nesbitt; that is correct.”</p>

<p>“He’s reading Herodotus,” said Dick to himself. “But
who in thunder is that with him?”</p>

<p>“‘The Nile,’” continued Trevor, “‘also produces otters,
which Egyptians venerate, as they do also the fish
named lepidotus—so called on account of its spots, which
resemble those of a leopard—and the eel; these are sacred
to the Nile, as among birds is one named chenalopex.’
What is that, professor?”</p>

<p>“The chenalopex,” responded the deep voice, “is a
bird——”</p>

<p>But Dick’s curiosity got the better of him at this point,
and he opened the door and entered. At the study table
was Trevor, Dick’s volume of Herodotus open before him,
and a Greek lexicon at his elbow. Dick stared about the
room in surprise. Save for Trevor and himself it was
empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“What in thunder——” he began.</p>

<p>“Hope,” said Trevor, pointing a paper-knife at him in
the manner of Professor Garrison, and speaking sternly in
deep tones, “take your seat, sir. The habit of tardiness
appears to be growing upon you, sir. Pattern your conduct
upon that of the excellently punctual Nesbitt.”</p>

<p>Dick seized Trevor’s head and rubbed his nose violently
into Herodotus. “You silly chump, you! What do you
think you’re doing?”</p>

<p>“Amusing myself, I fancy. What can a chap do when
his roommate goes off and leaves him this way?” He
struck the paper-knife against the green shade of the drop-light.
“Beg pardon, professor, I believe the bell rang.”
Then, in the professor’s voice, “The bell, Nesbitt? Ah, the
time passes very quickly when deep in the beautiful utterances
of Herodotus. We will begin to-morrow where we
leave off this morning, at the seventy-first paragraph.”
Trevor slammed the book shut, jumped up, and grinned at
Dick.</p>

<p>“You’d better be learning your own lessons than mine,”
laughed the latter. “And, now that Professor Garrison’s
gone, I propose to go to bed.”</p>

<p>Long after the light was out Trevor sat up suddenly
and asked:</p>

<p>“I say, Dick, did you thump Taylor?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the drowsy answer. Trevor snuggled back
under the clothes, grumbling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you expect to amount to when you grow
up,” he asked disgustedly, “if you continue to neglect your
opportunities in this way?”</p>

<p>The next day Waters, rowing at five in the first squad,
informed Dick that, because of not having enough time
for his studies, he had decided to stop work with the crew.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>IN THE BOAT</small></h2>


<p>When, on the following Saturday, Coach Kirk again
visited Hillton, Dick had a sorry report to make: Taylor
obdurate; Waters gone; two members of the second
squad ill.</p>

<p>“Taylor absolutely refuses, eh?” said the coach, studying
Dick’s face. “Well, if he won’t he won’t, and we must
do our best without him. And Waters has dropped out,
too, you say? He was at five, wasn’t he? Well, that’s
another good man lost. You’ve tried to persuade him to
come back?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I did all I could.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Is Waters a particular friend of Taylor’s?”</p>

<p>“I think they’re rather chummy.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, Hope, I can’t pass behind you in this
matter; it’s your business to look after the fellows, and if
you can’t get them to stay in training, that ends it. We
must do the best we can with what we’ve got. We’ll try
Nesbitt at four to-day, and put Rankin of the second squad
into Waters’s place. And, by the way, we’d better divide
the second; make a third squad. That will leave two over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
won’t it? Two men, I mean? I thought so. I wish to
goodness we had a second set of machines here. However——
By the way, Hope, you’re not looking very fit
to-day; feel pretty well, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m all right; didn’t sleep very steady last night,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to look after yourself carefully. If
you go off your feed we <em>will</em> be in a hole. Now I want
to see Beck a minute or two before we start to rowing.”
And Kirk strode out onto the floor, and as he went he said
to himself: “Plain as daylight; Hope and Taylor are at
loggerheads, and Taylor’s persuaded Waters to leave. Nice
state of affairs!”</p>

<p>February passed into March, and March, after performing
its usual æolian repertoire, subsided toward the end of
its reign in preparation for a lamblike exit. And one
morning Dick pushed up the blind and, according to his custom
of weeks past, looked toward the river. And, lo, the
water sparkled deeply blue under a springlike sun, and,
save for a patch here and there along the margins and in
the lee of the islands, was clear of ice.</p>

<p>“The river’s open at last!” he shouted to Trevor. And
that youth hurried to the window to see the marvel with
his own eyes.</p>

<p>“Good work! I say, Dick, it looks warm enough to
go in swimming. Will we get out to-day?”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess we’ll wait until Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Saturday! But, jumping jiminy, this is only Tuesday!”
exclaimed Trevor. “How can you expect a chap to
grind away in the gym on a day like this?” He pushed the
window up and threw himself over the sill, kicking his heels
delightedly and breathing in the fresh, moist air greedily.
A fringe of icicles above dripped water down onto his
bare neck, and he giggled hysterically. “Just like a needle
bath,” he sputtered.</p>

<p>“Come on and get dressed,” said Dick, “and let’s go
over to breakfast.”</p>

<p>“All right; wait until I eat an icicle.” He reached
up and broke off several. “Have one?”</p>

<p>“No, and no more will you,” replied Dick, knocking
them out of his hand. “When you’re in training for the
boat you can’t eat icicles; they’ll give you pains in your
tummy.”</p>

<p>“Rot,” said Trevor; “there’s nothing more healthful
than a nice underdone icicle just before breakfast.”</p>

<p>The boat-house on the following Saturday afternoon was
a scene of much activity and color. The fellows turned out
almost to a man for a look at the crews at work, and the
second and third squad stood by and watched enviously
while their more fortunate friends lifted one of the long
cedar shells from the house and placed it in the water at
the end of the float. The coxswain, an upper middle lad
named Keene, called the numbers, and, one by one, Trevor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
by virtue of his place at four, leading, the first squad entered
the boat. Kirk contented himself to-day with a point
of vantage on the landing, for the tiny naphtha launch was
not yet ready for duty.</p>

<p>“Get your feet into the stretchers, men, and see how
they feel. How is that, Six, too long? Hold her steady,
you fellows. That’s better, isn’t it?” And when the last
stretcher had been placed to suit: “Keene, keep the boat
in the stretch here by the landing and inshore as much
as you can. All right.”</p>

<p>“Get ready,” called the coxswain. The boat was
pushed off from the float. “Forward!” The crew moved
up with their slides. “Paddle!” and the shell floated out
into the stream, her bow pointing up the river. “Easy
all!” The paddling ceased and the boat lay motionless.
“Forward!” The eight bodies bent. “Are you ready?
Row!” and the blades swirled through the water and the
boat leaped forward. Dick, at stroke, pulled leisurely, and
after the first three or four strokes the rest of the eight
caught the time, and the locks clicked in unison. At a
little distance up-stream the boat was turned, and, with
the same long, leisurely stroke, was brought back and past
the landing, where Kirk, eagle-eyed, watched the work
silently. Down-stream the shell was again turned, and,
when it was once more opposite the float, was brought to
a stop.</p>

<p>“Seven, keep your eyes in the boat and watch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
stroke,” called Kirk. “Five, you’re too late every time.
Four, you don’t finish out. Bring your hands home. Two,
keep your shoulders down at the finish. Cox, watch the
boat; coming down just now she rolled like a log; keep an
eye on Three and Bow; I think they’re the offenders. Try
it again.”</p>

<p>And off went the boat once more, turned, passed the
landing, and finally was again brought up that the coach
might continue his criticism. Then the first squad was
released and the second was given a few minutes instruction
in watermanship, merely taking their places in the
boat, handling the oars and paddling to and fro about the
float. The third squad followed, and as each was released
it was sent off for a run.</p>

<p>Among the fellows who watched the work of the crews
that afternoon was Roy Taylor. It would, perhaps, be
more truthful to say that he divided his watching between
the crew and the coach. And from the latter he learned as
much as from the former, and what he saw was evidently
to his liking, for he went off up the steps whistling thoughtfully
but with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’ll give Hope another three weeks to come around,”
he said to himself, as he passed Society House and turned
toward Academy Building. “If by that time he hasn’t consented
to give me the captaincy, I’ll—I’ll eat my hat. I
never saw such a duffer in a boat as that fellow they had
to-day in my place at seven. And Kirk thinks the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
way, too; he tried to hide what he felt, but I know his
way of tugging at his mustache and grinning pleasantly
when he is worried; and he was worried to-day, all right.
And I don’t blame him”—with a grin—“for there are
three men in that first squad that wouldn’t last half a mile
in a race with a girls’ school! Oh, yes, I guess old Hope
will be around to see me before long!”</p>

<p>And Taylor pushed his way past the green leather doors
of the library and, finding a book, went busily to work with
pad and pencil—for whatever else might have been said
about Roy Taylor, he was at least diligent at his studies,
and stood high in his class.</p>

<p>Dick, followed by Trevor and the rest of the first squad,
finished a mile run over the soft road, and came swinging
up to the gymnasium an hour before supper-time, panting
and tuckered, but in a most enjoyable glow and with appetites
that protested strongly against the time that must
elapse ere they could be satisfied. After a shower-bath
Dick and Trevor walked across to Masters together, and,
pulling a blanket over their feet, perched themselves on the
broad window-seat in the lingering glow of the sun, and
leaned back luxuriously against the pillows. Ever since the
morning four days previous, when Dick had looked out
to find the Hudson clear of ice, the boys had scorned fires,
and, although the room had a way of getting cold toward
evening, they insisted that spring had come, and that wood
fires were a survival of the dark ages of midwinter. Trevor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
stretched his arms and yawned, and the Latin book on
his lap fell unheeded to the floor.</p>

<p>“That was something like, to-day,” he said. “It was
worth all that work in the gym, every minute of it. I
say, Dick, Kirk looked rather well satisfied with us, I
thought, eh?”</p>

<p>“He looked that way,” answered Dick, “but don’t deceive
yourself into thinking that he felt so. Not a bit of
it; he was grumpy clean through; you could tell that by
his grin; he always grins when he’s grumpy; makes you
think of the—thingumbob—what is it that cries when it
eats people?”</p>

<p>“Mouse?” asked Trevor innocently.</p>

<p>“Get out! Crocodile, I mean. That’s Kirk’s way. No,
he wasn’t happy to-day, and I don’t blame him, for, oh,
Trevor, my child, Jones fills Taylor’s place about as well
as a wax doll would. And Rankin means well, but hasn’t
got it in him, and Arnold’s just a makeshift, after all; I
thought he was going to prove a good man; and Milton
doesn’t seem to understand what he’s doing half the time.”</p>

<p>“And Nesbitt rows as though he was chopping wood,”
laughed Trevor, with a questioning accent.</p>

<p>“Nesbitt will do, I guess, after he’s been at it a little
longer,” answered Dick. “Hang it all! I rowed like a kid
to-day myself! I don’t know what’s got into me. I wish—by
Jove! I honestly do wish that Taylor or anybody else
was captain, Trevor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rot! What kind of a captain would Taylor make,
for goodness’ sake? Cheer up, my hearty; you’ll feel better
after supper.”</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will. What you need is some nice cold
roast beef, milk toast, egg muffins, peach marmalade, and a
cup of cocoa; with plenty of mustard.”</p>

<p>“In the cocoa?” grinned Dick.</p>

<p>“Idiot! No, on the beef. That’s right, smile; keep it
up; now you’re feeling better. And something tells me,
Dick, that it’s pretty near time to wash our nice little hands
and faces. Say, let’s cut lessons to-night and go over to
the village and see Carl and Stewart, eh?”</p>

<p>And so it was agreed.</p>

<p>Spring vacation came, and for a week partially depopulated
the academy, interfering sadly with crew work. Trevor
joined his father in New York, and Stewart Earle went
home; but Dick and Carl stuck to their posts, Dick on
the river and Carl on the baseball diamond, where he was
turning out a nine that was destined to be proudly remembered
at Hillton for many years. Dick found himself
in full authority during the vacation week, for Malcolm
Kirk had not as yet taken up his residence in the
village, and with no recitations to attend he was able to
give almost his entire time to rowing affairs. Half of the
first squad were away, but he filled the empty places from
the second, put Crocker temporarily at stroke, and coached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the impromptu crew from a small boat in which he rowed
frantically about in efforts to secure satisfactory points of
observation. One rather bleak afternoon he was in his
tub just off the landing as the shell, returning from down
the river, swept abreast of him. He stood up on the
thwarts, balancing himself with an oar, in order to better
view the work.</p>

<p>“Seven, you’re rowing light,” he called. “You begin
to lower your hands too early; your blade is half out of
water at the finish. Five, you put your blade too deep.”
The shell was passing now, and he raised his voice and
unconsciously leaned forward. “Grip the water with the
blade——”</p>

<p>There was a splash and a cry from the handful of
loiterers on the float; the tub rocked merrily; Dick’s cap
floated off down-stream, and Dick had disappeared from
sight.</p>

<p>“Hold hard all!” yelled the cox. Then, “Back all!”
But ere the shell had lost way enough to allow of its being
paddled to the rescue, Dick had reappeared a few yards
down-stream, had made hand over hand for his boat, and
was clinging to the side, wiping the water from his face.</p>

<p>“At an angle!” he shouted, continuing his instructions
as though no interruption had occurred, “and then
you won’t be likely to ‘slice.’ Take ’em along, Keene;
and, Stroke, lengthen out a bit!”</p>

<p>Amid the laughter of the onlookers the shell swept on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
again up the river, and Dick crawled over the bow of
his tub and put back to the boat-house for a change of clothing.</p>

<p>But despite his most heroic efforts, neither the first nor
second squad worked well; there appeared to be lack of
spirit; a sort of “What’s the good of anything? Nothing!”
feeling seemed to prevail among the candidates, and
the discouragement that had been growing on Dick ever
since Taylor’s resignation now took possession of him
wholly. If Trevor had been there, he told himself, it
wouldn’t have been so bad; he would have had some one
to whom to confide his troubles; some one that would have
listened patiently to his groans and growls, and who, by his
unfailing cheerfulness and good nature, would have won
him from his “blues.” He missed Trevor a good deal; in
the evenings especially the study seemed lonesome, and with
none to talk to, Dick could gain no entertainment from
books, but gathered his lists and memoranda of crew men
before him and pondered and studied over them until bedtime
came and he crawled between the covers fagged and
low-spirited.</p>

<p>In the St. Eustace Academy paper he read glowing accounts
of the Blue’s eight that worried him yet more.
Fifty-odd candidates had reported there for work shortly
after the beginning of the new year; a spirit of enthusiasm
reigned over the entire student body; the coach who had
piloted the eight to a victory over Hillton the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
spring had again taken hold, and the most encouraging
prospect stretched before the rival school. With a groan
he contrasted those conditions with the conditions which
prevailed at Hillton; almost total indifference on the part
of the school at large; a woful deficiency in candidates,
both as to numbers and quality; a financial state which,
while robust enough to supply the absolute necessities of
the crews, was too slight to afford any of the extra expenditures
that might in the struggle for success smooth the path
toward victory; and, last of all, but not least, intestine
strife.</p>

<p>On one occasion, heartily wearied of his own company,
Dick slammed the door of Number 16 and plodded over
the muddy roads to Carl Gray’s room in the village.
Carl’s welcome was enthusiastic enough, but to Dick, with
his own troubles everlastingly revolving themselves in his
brain, the other lad’s chatter of baseball problems—none of
them, Dick thought, weighty enough to cause a moment’s
worry—only bored him; and he left early and made his
way back to Masters and bed envious of Carl’s good fortune
and more down on his luck than before.</p>

<p>Vacation came to an end in the early April days, and
Trevor and the rest of the fellows returned to school,
brightened and cheered in mind and body. Kirk also arrived,
bag and baggage, and took up his quarters in the
village, and Dick, with feelings of relief, mentally shoved
a portion of his load of troubles onto the broad shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the head coach. Trevor viewed Dick’s appearance with
alarm.</p>

<p>“What in the name of all that’s silly have you been
doing to yourself?” he demanded. “You look like a brass
farthing of an old and rare vintage! Been ill?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Dick. And then, acting on a sudden
impulse, an overpowering desire for a confidant, he told
Trevor everything; of Taylor’s desertion and Waters’s; of
his fears for crew success; and finally of Taylor’s demands,
ending with: “And I’ve decided to do it; I’m going to resign
the captaincy and give him what he wants; I’m tired
to death of the whole silly business!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk so sick!” cried Trevor in angry disgust.
“You’ll resign nothing! I—I’d see Taylor at the bottom of
the river before I’d come to terms with him! Give him the
captaincy, indeed! Now, you get that notion out of your
head, Dick, or I’ll—I’ll——”</p>

<p>“It’s all well enough for you to talk that way,” grumbled
Dick, letting his discouragement have full sway and
gaining not a little comfort thereby, “but I tell you things
have come to a pass where something’s got to be done!
We haven’t any crew; they’re just a boatful of chumps;
they don’t care a fig whether they ever learn to row! And
look at the rest of the fellows! They don’t care, either;
they’d just as lief see Hillton beaten as not!”</p>

<p>“Rot!” ejaculated Trevor. “Of course they care. I’ll
own they’re blooming chilly about it, but it’s because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
don’t know what’s going on. And, look here, Dick, you’ve
got no earthly right to resign from the captaincy for such
a reason as that; if the fellows had wanted Roy Taylor
for captain they’d have elected him. But they didn’t; they
wanted you; so they elected you; and, by ginger, you’ve got
to carry the thing through!”</p>

<p>“Much the fellows care!”</p>

<p>“And, look here, now, Dick, honestly, what kind of a
fool captain would Taylor make?”</p>

<p>“As good as I, I dare say. He knows how to row——”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing; that doesn’t always fit a man to boss
a lot of other men; a good captain’s got to know more than
just how to row. He’s got to have grit, and patience, and
generalship, and he’s got to be a fellow that the other
fellows will look up to and believe in and obey; and that’s
not Roy Taylor, not by a jugful, my angel child!”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Dick less dolefully.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you go to doing anything foolish. Cheer
up; take a rest; let the crew go hang for a few days.”</p>

<p>“Can’t do that,” answered Dick. “Wish I could.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, Dick, stop thinking about your
troubles, like a good fellow. And, if you won’t give up
this bally resignation idea, why, promise not to do anything
about it for—let me see—for two weeks; will you?”</p>

<p>And Dick grinned a trifle sheepishly and promised.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>DICK SURRENDERS</small></h2>


<p>“Stroke side, catch the beginning sharper; the boat
rolls down on the bow oars. Bow side, keep your hands up!
That’s better! Steady now, all; don’t rush forward. Keep
your swing long; you’re all rowing too short in the water!...
Every man keep his eyes in the boat. Watch the man
in front of you and follow his movements; make a machine
of yourself!... You’re out of time again! Listen for
the rattle of the locks. There ought to be but one sound,
and I can hear at least five. Use your ears, men!...
Stroke, lengthen out, lengthen out; you’re much too
short!”</p>

<p>And Malcolm Kirk, standing in the bow of the little
naphtha launch Terrible, took his megaphone from his
mouth and motioned to the man in charge. The Terrible
swung around in a short swirl of blue water and headed
down-stream, waiting for the shell to make its long turn
above. Across the sun-kissed wavelets came the sound of
the coxswain’s voice:</p>

<p>“Easy all!... Three and Bow, paddle. Stroke and
Six, back water!... Forward!... Are you ready?...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Row!” Then down the river came the boat, looking
for all the world like an enormous water-bug, its eight
long legs treading the bosom of the river in unison, or
at least in unison so far as the ordinary observer would
have been able to judge, but not at all satisfactory in that
respect to the motionless figure on the launch. The eight
backs bent together and the boat sped past the Terrible,
which instantly <em>puff-puffed</em> impatiently and started in pursuit,
taking up a position off Number Two.</p>

<p>“Stroke, you’re still too short,” began the coach all
over again. “Keep it low and long!... Seven, you bend
your arms too soon; swing back with them perfectly
straight; remember, you can’t make them do your work;
hard against the stretcher, now!... That’s a bit better....
Six, you start your slide too soon; I’ve spoken to you
of that often enough. Get your whole body-weight well
onto the stroke before you drive your slide away.... Sit
up, Five! Ram that slide back to the limit!... Four,
your body’s falling out of the boat! Keep your outside
leg and hand firm!... Three, drop your hands more so
as to get your oar out of the water clean.... That’s
vastly better!... Two, you’re too slow with your hands
and too quick with your body. Shoot your hands away
lively and turn your inside wrist sharply; then follow with
the body more slowly.... Bow, you’re rolling the boat
again! Catch the water more sharply!... Time! Time!
Listen for the rattle of the oars in the locks, men; you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
beastly ragged!... Stroke, you’re rowing light again!
Keep your hands up to the end!”</p>

<p>And so on for another half mile, when the boat was
again turned and brought back to the landing, where the
second squad were embarking under the direction of its
coxswain. “Let her run!” cried Keene, and the first squad
lifted their dripping oars from the water and the shell approached
the float silently, easily. “Touch her a bit,
Stroke.” Dick’s oar went back into the water and he paddled
gently until the boat’s head was brought nearer to
the landing. “Easy, Stroke. Mind your oars, bow side!”
Then the shell floated alongside, was seized by those on the
float, and the oars were unlocked. “Stroke!... Bow!...
Seven!... Two!... Six!... Three!... Five!...
Four!” called the coxswain, and one by one the crew
stepped out. Then the shell was lifted, dripping and shining
from the water, and borne into the house. The second
squad had meanwhile paddled into the stream, and their
troubles had begun. Down the river they went, followed
by the inexorable Kirk and the puffing Terrible.</p>

<p>Dick, weary, out of tune with himself for his sorry
work, led the first squad off on a short run, down the river-path
to the campus, across the golf links, still too soft for
good running, and back by Academy Road toward the
gymnasium, to baths and rest. And as he trotted along the
voice of the coach echoed continuously in his ears: “<em>Stroke,
you’re rowing light again!</em>” Anger at his own miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
performance in the boat and an intense loathing for it all
seized upon him. Taylor could have the job, and welcome!
He felt a downright hate of the fellows behind him because
they had witnessed his degradation. What could they
think, he asked himself, of a captain who had been cautioned
four times for the same fault in a half-hour’s work?
How could they—what had been Trevor’s words? Look
up? Yes—how could they look up to such a captain?
Hang them! What did he care what they thought of him?
A pack of selfish, half-hearted idiots, they were! But in the
next moment he acknowledged that he did care—a good
deal. And with that the squad reached the gymnasium, and
Dick pulled himself wearily up the steps. On the way
across the yard later he encountered Keene.</p>

<p>“Hope, Kirk asked me to tell you he’d like to have
you go over to his room this evening after supper if you
can. I was on my way to your room.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll go. I say, Keene, what did you think
of us to-day?”</p>

<p>One of the coxswain’s virtues was a fondness for plain,
direct language unadorned with verbiage.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” he answered earnestly. Dick nodded, made
a pathetic effort at a smile, and strode on. Keene watched
him thoughtfully until he disappeared into Masters Hall,
then he turned and went on his way. “He won’t last until
the race,” he muttered. “Rowed like a farmer to-day, and
looks now as though tired out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Directly after supper Dick walked to the village and
found Malcolm Kirk in his room at Hutchins’s boarding-house.
He was seated before an open window, his feet on
the sill, puffing voluminously at a brier pipe. Upon Dick’s
advent he greeted him smilingly and pushed forward an
armchair.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Hope. It was very good of you to come
over. I might have done the journeying myself and called
on you, but I thought we’d have a better chance of a
talk here in my diggings. Rather an off-day, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Dick relapsed into silence after this monosyllabic
reply, and Kirk occupied himself with his pipe for a
moment. Then he faced Dick, with a return to his usual
grave aspect.</p>

<p>“Hope, you’re not looking well. I want you to lay off
for a week. You’re stale; I could see that by your work
to-day, and your face tells as much now. We can’t risk you
getting laid up, you know.”</p>

<p>“I feel pretty well,” answered Dick. “But I don’t
blame you for thinking I’m stale after the exhibition I
made to-day,” he added bitterly. “I don’t know what got
into me; I rowed like a—like a chump!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let that trouble you,” replied Kirk, soothingly.
“It’s bound to happen once in a while; I never saw
a crew captain yet that didn’t go off his work for a bit at
some stage in the game; in fact, I should be rather afraid
of one that didn’t; I should think he was like the Sunday-school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
books—too good to be true. How’s your appetite?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair.”</p>

<p>“Sleep well?”</p>

<p>“Not very.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because—— Oh, I suppose it’s because of the
wretched state things are in.”</p>

<p>“Crew, you mean?”</p>

<p>Dick nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, affairs don’t look bright just at present; I’ll
acknowledge that, Hope; in fact, it’s best to own up to the
condition and face it squarely. But that doesn’t mean that
there’s anything to be gained by worrying about it. No,
take my advice; do your best, knock off work for a few
days, make up your mind that everything’s going to come
out right in the end, and keep whistling. After all—though
I wouldn’t say this to any one but you—there’s not
a particle of disgrace in being beaten, not a particle. I
don’t want you to imagine that I’ve got it into my head
that we’re going to be beaten; for I haven’t; I’ve seen
plenty of more hopeless-looking cases than this right themselves
when the time came. But what I mean is that it’s a
poor plan to tell yourself that defeat is disgraceful; if you
believe that you’ll find yourself in a condition for suicide
some day; for every chap, no matter who, has got to face
defeat at some time in his life. And the chap that can take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a drubbing and come up smiling is the one that is going to
be happiest and going to make the most of his life. The
only time when defeat brings disgrace is when you haven’t
done your honest best. But I didn’t ask you over here
to listen to a lecture. What do you think of my plan?
Will you lay off a while? To-day’s Friday; suppose we say
until a week from to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Dick dejectedly. “If you think
I’d better; though, as far as I’m concerned, I don’t think
there’s any necessity for it.”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t; never saw a man who did. But
we’ll call it a whim of mine, if you like. Well, that’s settled.
Don’t come near the river; don’t talk about rowing,
and don’t even think of it if you can help it; take a walk
every day, or a run, and do just enough work at the weights
meanwhile to keep your muscles stretchy. Do you think
Crocker will be a good man to put in at stroke while you’re
out of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dick. “You know I had him rowing
there during vacation; he did first-rate.”</p>

<p>“All right. I think we’d better pick the first and second
crews next week and send them to training-table. It’s
rather earlier than last year, but then we’re a bit more
backward. Now, another thing. That fellow Jones is no
earthly use in Taylor’s position; in the first place, he’s not
varsity stuff; in the second place he can’t row to any remarkable
extent, and there isn’t time to start in and teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
him the rudiments of the art at this late day; in short, he’s
out of the question. And I don’t know of any fellow that
I care to try there. Do you?”</p>

<p>“Not unless it’s Garvier of the second,” answered Dick.
“He’s got the weight and he’s hard-working; he pulls a
rather good oar, too; only—well, I’m afraid he lacks sand.”</p>

<p>Kirk nodded and blew a volume of smoke toward the
window.</p>

<p>“I’d thought of Garvier, but your estimate of him is
just about mine; as you say, I don’t think he’s got enough
grit for Seven. When you come down to it Seven needs
almost as much hard horse-sense, coolness, and judgment
as does Stroke. In fact, the style of the crew depends more
on him than on Stroke. I believe I’d rather put up with a
poor Stroke than a poor Number 7. No, decidedly Garvier
won’t do. How about Crocker?”</p>

<p>“He might do, of course, only I think he’s about where
he belongs now, don’t you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so, although—— Well, there seems
to be but one thing to do.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Get Taylor back. Now wait a moment, Hope. I
don’t propose to interfere with you, not a particle.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t any such idea,” protested Dick.</p>

<p>“All right. What I propose to do is to go with you to
see this contrary beggar and make one more appeal to
him; and if you say now that you’d rather not ask him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
again—for I can well understand your having feeling in the
matter—I’ll drop the project and say nothing more about
it; we’ll fight it out without Taylor. On the other hand,
if you are willing to try again and don’t object to my—well,
sticking my finger into your pie, as it were, we’ll
go together and have it out with him. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>Dick hesitated, and Kirk, without appearing to do so,
eyed him intently. Kirk, believing that a quarrel existed
between the two boys, imagined that Dick was having a
struggle with his vanity. “And,” Kirk told himself, “I
sha’n’t blame him if he refuses.” But Dick didn’t refuse.
Knowing upon what terms Taylor would alone consent to
return to training, he mentally threw back his shoulders and
replied:</p>

<p>“I think there may be a chance of Taylor’s having reconsidered.
But I think your request would have more
weight, and I’d rather that you’d ask him. As for your interfering,
I hadn’t thought of it; and I shouldn’t consider
it that, sir. If you like we’ll go over and see him now.”</p>

<p>“A good idea; no time like the present. Where does
he room?”</p>

<p>“At Coolidge’s.”</p>

<p>“Coolidge’s? I guess I don’t know that. Is it near
here?”</p>

<p>“Well, not very, it’s almost the last house in the village,
I guess; just beyond the Episcopal Church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t thinking of the walk,” returned
Kirk. “I was only wondering if it was an old house
I’d forgotten. But I think it must be new since my
day.”</p>

<p>“It is, I guess; looks as though it hadn’t been up more
than a few years.”</p>

<p>Kirk took a walking-stick from a corner, turned down
the light, and the two left the house together and proceeded
through the village, past the Town Hall, the Eagle Tavern,
and the church that Dick had mentioned, until a large
square frame house loomed up on their left. Dick led the
way upstairs to Taylor’s room, and found that youth entertaining
Waters and another boy, both of whom, however,
took their leave at once. Taylor greeted Dick easily,
and the coach respectfully, but was quite evidently far from
being at his ease. His first thought was that Dick had confided
everything to Kirk, and that there was trouble ahead.
But the coach’s introduction dispelled that illusion, and he
breathed easier.</p>

<p>“Taylor, Hope and I have come to ask your help,” announced
Kirk, smiling but earnest. “To put the matter
in few words, we’re in a hard way for a man at Number
7 in the varsity boat, and we want you to reconsider your
decision and come back.”</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow Kirk’s argument; he said
practically what Dick had said on the occasions of his two
previous visits, although he said it all a trifle more forcibly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and with a suggestion of authority. And when he had finished,
Taylor, who seemed greatly impressed, turned toward
Dick.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of it in just that way, sir,” he said,
with an assumption of frankness, “and if Hope wants me
to return I’ll do so.”</p>

<p>“Hope’s wishes are the same as mine,” answered Kirk
gravely. “I have acted in the matter only with his full
consent.”</p>

<p>But Taylor’s eyes were still on Dick, and he awaited
that youth’s reply. Now that the moment had come to
relinquish his honors Dick experienced a moment of revolt.
He well knew what Taylor’s words meant; he was to be
held to the terms of the offer made on his last visit. It was
hardly fair, to be sure, since, with Kirk present, there was
but one reply he could make. But after the first twinge of
regret he was glad that it was so; the matter had been settled
for him. He would resign the captaincy and Taylor
should have it; he would still row in the boat, and, when
the success of the crew was at stake, his sacrifice was but
little after all. All this passed through his mind in the
fraction of a second, and it was with but the slightest hesitation
that he met Taylor’s look, and smiled across at him.
The smile was prompted by relief and not by friendship;
but this Kirk could not know, and so was heartily glad to
see it; and concluded thereby that the quarrel between the
two lads was at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick, “I want you to come back. I’ve
never wanted anything else.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” questioned Taylor’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I do,” answered Dick’s.</p>

<p>Kirk arose. “That’s settled, then, and I’m very glad.
I don’t think you’ll regret it, Taylor. And I’ll look for
you to-morrow afternoon, shall I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” He accompanied them down to the door
courteously, and bade them good-night smilingly from the
stoop. When the two reached the street Kirk heaved a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“That’s over with,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” echoed Dick, “it’s over.”</p>

<p>But Taylor didn’t report for crew work on the following
afternoon. Instead, a message came saying that he had
fallen while coming out of chapel, and had sprained his
right knee. And Dick, wistfully watching the distant boat
from his window, wondered whether Fate had changed its
mind.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>DEFIES THE LAW</small></h2>


<p>Dick strictly obeyed orders. He kept away from the
river and contented himself with observing the progress of
the crews through a pair of field-glasses from the study
as long as the boats were down the river. When they
passed up he went across the hall and called on Williams,
always popping himself down on the window-seat and
always remaining until the first or second boats had once
more returned down stream. Williams informed him dryly
that he was honored by his visits, but not greatly interested
in his conversation, which consisted upon such occasions of
monosyllabic replies, usually made with his head half a
yard out the window. As far as not thinking of rowing was
concerned, it was a downright impossibility; but he did try
not to talk about it, and was assisted by Trevor.</p>

<p>“How’d it go to-day?” Dick would ask with elaborate
carelessness.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” Trevor would grunt.</p>

<p>“Do you think Milton did better?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say.”</p>

<p>“I noticed you rowed about thirty-four going up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did we?”</p>

<p>“Did you? Don’t you know you did? Don’t you know
anything?” Dick would exclaim in disgust.</p>

<p>“Not on that subject, so shut up!”</p>

<p>The varsity and second crews had been picked and sent
to training-table on the Monday following the visit to Taylor.
The varsity went to “Mother” Burke’s, in the village,
and the second had a nice, long table all to themselves in
dining-hall. Dick’s chair at the head of the board was
vacant as yet, by request of Kirk, who explained that if
Dick was to keep his mind off rowing affairs the varsity
training-table was no place for him. But that was a long
week to Dick, and he yearned for Saturday to come, even
though, as he acknowledged, the enforced leisure had already
benefited him. His color was better, his appetite
was coming back, and he slept a good nine hours every
night. But nevertheless the inactivity was hard to bear,
and he thought that never before had the days lagged so.</p>

<p>The captaincy was still his, for Taylor’s accident had
afforded him a respite. The boy’s knee was in bad shape,
Dick learned, and it would be all of a month before he
could be fit to take his place in the boat, although it had
been agreed between him and Kirk that he should report
with the other members of the crew at practice as soon as
he was able to get about; he could at least watch the others
at work and keep up with the march of events. He had
sent a note to Dick the day following his fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Friend Hope,” he wrote, “I guess you had best let
that matter wait until I’m out-of-doors again. This is
beastly luck, but we must make the best of it. Of course
you understand that I shall hold you to your promise, so
perhaps you had better work around toward you know
what; kind of pave the way, you know. Send me an answer
by Waters or Hayden.”</p>

<p>And Dick had answered “All right.”</p>

<p>The evil day was simply postponed, but meanwhile he
would go ahead and do what he could. Taylor’s agreement
had already borne fruit in the shape of the acquisition to
the varsity and second boats of Waters and two other oarsmen,
all three seniors and experienced men. This had puzzled
Kirk not a little, but he decided not to look a gift
horse in the mouth, and so said nothing; merely set the
new candidates to work and thanked his stars.</p>

<p>When Saturday came, and Dick’s period of voluntary
probation came to an end, rowing affairs at Hillton looked
far more promising. Waters was back at five in the
varsity boat, and another of Taylor’s disciples, Whitman,
had displaced the unfortunate Arnold at Number 2.
Crocker went back to his place at six, and Dick once
more found himself with his toes in the straps and the
stroke oar in his hands, and was greatly comforted. He
rowed in his old form that afternoon, and the rest of the
crew seemed to gather confidence and tone from him. The
new material, despite their lack of training during the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of the season, fitted well into their places, and the afternoon’s
practice was, on the whole, decidedly encouraging.</p>

<p>The next morning Dick took his place at the head of the
varsity training-table and ate his steak and baked potatoes
and eggs with all the relish in the world, and would have
been entirely happy had it not been for the knowledge that
soon, another week at the most, he must yield his position.
It was hard to have performed the difficult part, to have
worked and planned ever since the preceding spring, to have
worried through discouragements and toiled through the
grinding monotony of the preliminary season, only to have
to yield the honor to another when things had at length
begun to look hopeful. Well, it might mean success in
the race; and success was what he desired; only—well, he
groaned when he pictured to himself the Crimson crew
sweeping over the line ahead of St. Eustace, and realized
that not he, but Roy Taylor, would come in for the glory
that belonged to a victorious crew captain.</p>

<p>The next evening, Monday, Trevor brought up a copy
of The Hilltonian for May, and Dick read aloud the article
on the crew. After a summary of rowing at Hillton in
former years, the article continued: “With fewer candidates
to work with than in any year within memory, and
with a lamentable lack of encouragement from the student
body, Coach Kirk and Captain Hope have succeeded in
forming a varsity and a second crew that compare favorably
with any of recent years, and that are superior in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
most particulars to the eights of last spring. The return
to the varsity squad of Taylor, S., and Whitman, S., is cause
for congratulations, as both are excellent oarsmen and have
had experience, Taylor in last year’s varsity boat, and Whitman
in last year’s second. The varsity crew as at present
made up is as follows: Captain Hope, Stroke; Jones, No. 7;
Crocker, No. 6; Waters, No. 5; Nesbitt, No. 4; Milton,
No. 3; Whitman, No. 2; Shield, Bow. Taylor will displace
Jones at No. 7, it is expected, when he returns to work,
which will probably be within the next fortnight.</p>

<p>“It is not surprising that Coach Kirk has selected these
men to make up the varsity squad, as they are easily the
best oarsmen among the candidates which presented themselves
at the commencement of the season. Four of these
men rowed in last year’s varsity, and of the balance two
have had extensive experience in rowing. Coach Kirk says
that the present selection is by no means final, and will be
changed from time to time as he sees fit. Nevertheless, it
is probable that the crew which will row against St. Eustace
will be made up practically as above. Beginning next
week Coach Kirk will take the men out two by two in
a pair-oar, following the practice of last year. The varsity
and second squads will have gone to their training-tables by
the time this issue of The Hilltonian is published, and with
that hard work may be said to have begun. Altogether,
rowing affairs at Hillton are in an encouraging condition,
and a victory pronounced enough to wipe out the stigma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of last year’s defeat at the hands of our rivals may be confidently
expected. The progress of the crews will be closely
followed by The Hilltonian, and a criticism of the work of
the members will appear in our next issue.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was as certain of that pronounced victory as
he is,” said Dick as he laid the sheet aside.</p>

<p>“Who’s ‘he’?” asked Trevor.</p>

<p>“Singer, I guess; he thinks himself an authority on
rowing affairs, though I doubt if he knows an outrigger
from a thwart; but he’s a good fellow, all the same. Hello,
what are you going to do with that?”</p>

<p>Trevor was balancing himself precariously on the head
of the couch, and taking a tennis racket from a nail on
the wall.</p>

<p>“Going to get busy with it. Stewart and I are to
play a bit to-morrow. I rather fancy I’ll enter for the
tournament in June. I finished rather well in the singles
last spring, you know. Carter, a senior chap, beat me in
the semi-finals, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.”</p>

<p>“I never played the game but once,” answered Dick,
“and then I nearly ran myself to death. It was lots harder
than a mile on the track.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; a chap always runs too much when
he doesn’t know the game. I like it. There isn’t much
chance for golf this year, and so I fancy I’ll go in for tennis.”</p>

<p>“Well, good luck to you,” replied Dick, “only don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
twist your ankle or anything like that and have to give up
rowing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” answered his roommate. He had
secured the racket and was examining the gut critically.
“I fancy I’ll need a new one for the tournament,” he muttered.
Securing an old ball he slammed it around the room
for a while, until Dick, laying aside his book, arose in his
wrath and took both ball and racket away from him.
After that he walked disconsolately around the table for
several minutes, and at length settled himself grudgingly
to study. Dick had a hard lesson in German to master,
and it was well on toward ten o’clock when he finally put
down his books, yawned, and strolling to the window,
pushed aside the curtains and peered out. Trevor was
leisurely undressing in the bedroom when he heard Dick
call to him excitedly.</p>

<p>“Fire, Trevor! Come look, quick!”</p>

<p>Trevor came, trailing his trousers after him by one leg,
and leaned out beside his chum. Just to the right of Warren
Hall, in the direction of the village, shone a ruddy glow,
and even as they watched a tongue of flame made itself
visible.</p>

<p>“Where is that?” asked Dick. “It’s too far that way
to be the Eagle.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s the Episcopal Church,” answered Trevor,
excitedly. “Let’s go!” He struggled madly with his
trousers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, hurry up,” said Dick. Then, “By Jove,
Trevor, I’ll tell you what it is,” he called.</p>

<p>“What?” yelled Trevor from the bedroom.</p>

<p>“Why, Watson’s stables; they’re just about in that direction,
and——”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” screamed his chum. “Watson’s stables!
Come on! Hurry!” He dashed toward the door, coatless,
hatless, his vest half on.</p>

<p>“Wait for your coat, you idiot!” called Dick. But
the other was clattering down the stairs, and so, seizing
his own cap and Trevor’s, he followed. He caught up with
Trevor half-way to the gate. “Here’s your cap,” he
shouted.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that,” yelled Trevor. “Hurry up!
Think of poor old Muggins!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” muttered Dick. “I’d forgotten him!”
And he raced after. As they left the grounds the bell in
Academy Building began to ring the alarm, while from the
village other bells had already begun their note of warning.
The fire was hidden from their view now, but a rosy glare
in the sky above the trees and intervening buildings told
them that it still raged. Opposite the post-office they overtook
a group of men. “Know where it is?” asked Trevor.
But they didn’t, and the two boys sped on, soon leaving
them behind. But when they turned to pass the Town Hall
Trevor gave a cry of joy:</p>

<p>“It isn’t the stables! It isn’t the stables, Dick!” And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he was right; the fire was beyond them and more to the
left. “By Jove,” he went on, “I believe it’s the church
after all, or else—— What’s beyond that?”</p>

<p>“Beyond the church?” panted Dick. “Why, I don’t
know; nothing except Coolidge’s, I guess. Do you suppose
it’s that?”</p>

<p>“Must be,” answered Trevor. And then they turned
aside as the volunteer fire department, with a rabble of
curious men and boys following, rattled by. And now they
could see plainly the squat tower of the Episcopal Church
standing out boldly against the yellow glare.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> Coolidge’s!” cried Dick and Trevor in a breath,
and ran yet faster. When they reached the great, square
boarding-house they found it surrounded by a crowd of persons,
many of them Hillton boys who lived in the village.
The frame building was burning merrily, and the flames
had advanced to such a stage that it appeared doubtful if the
firemen could do much. But two lines of hose were stretched
and the pumps were manned, and the volunteer department
attacked the enemy valiantly. The entire right corner
of the house was ablaze from cellar to mansard roof, the
flames having gained undisputed sway of the three big
rooms there. The hall, as the boys could see from their
position near the front gate, was black with smoke which
poured out the open doorway in stifling volumes. Two
men suddenly emerged from it, staggering under the weight
of a long couch which they released to ready helpers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
yard. But when they started again for the doorway they
were stopped by a man whom the two boys recognized as
the town marshal.</p>

<p>“Can’t let you go in again, Mr. Coolidge,” they heard
him say. “Too risky.” And he was deaf to the expostulations
of the salvagers. As the firemen took the first hose
into the house the flames for a moment lighted up the hall,
throwing the narrow staircase into relief. The marshal
pointed, and the two men apparently recognized the force
of his objections, for they turned back and hurriedly set
about getting the goods with which the yard was strewn
into places of safety.</p>

<p>“I wonder how they got Taylor out with his sprained
knee,” said Dick to Trevor.</p>

<p>“Carried him, I fancy. I wonder where he is.” One
of the lads who had roomed in the doomed building, and
who was watching the conflagration with sentiments divided
between regret for his lost chattels and joy in the brilliant
spectacle, caught Trevor’s eye. “I say, Simpson,” he
called, “what did they do with Taylor?” But Simpson
shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; guess they took him across to Cupples’s.
I didn’t see him at all.” A terrible fear gripped Dick’s
heart. It showed in his face, for Trevor gasped and looked
about at a loss.</p>

<p>“But they <em>must</em> have got him out, Dick,” he cried.
“Wait, I’ll ask.” He darted toward the crowd in the yard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Dick followed. Mr. Coolidge, trembling with excitement
and his recent exertions, stood mopping his forehead just
inside the gate, and recounting for the fifth time the story
of the fire’s origin. To him came Trevor.</p>

<p>“Taylor, sir?” he asked in tones that trembled despite
that he told himself over and over that it was all right; that
Taylor must surely have been rescued. “Roy Taylor, Mr.
Coolidge? Did he—— Where was he taken, sir?”</p>

<p>“Taylor?” faltered the boarding-house keeper. “Why—I—I——
Who saw that Taylor boy?” he shouted, turning
to the group about him. The chatter ceased, and a
silence fell that chilled Trevor and Dick to the heart.
None answered for a moment. At last:</p>

<p>“He got out, didn’t he, George?” shrieked a woman’s
voice, shrill-toned and hysterical. “You know he got out,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>But Coolidge only shook his head, his face growing
ashen. “I—I don’t know! I asked the boys; they
said every one was out; you were here, and Sarah,
and——” A murmur of horror arose and grew. Dick,
pale-faced and sick at heart, stared at the burning building.
Suddenly in the street voices broke into exclamations of
horror; there was a pushing here and there; Dick turned
and heard a cry: “Where are the firemen? They can save
him!” The next instant Carl Gray, white-faced and
breathless, broke through the gate.</p>

<p>“There’s some one in that room back there! I saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
face at the window! I—it looked like Roy Taylor. Dick,
is that you? What shall we do?” Carl seized him by the
arms, staring miserably into his eyes, his hands trembling.
For a moment Dick stared back at him. Then, throwing off
his hands, he turned and without a word dashed toward the
front door.</p>

<p>“Dick! <em>Dick!</em>” shrieked Trevor. “Come back, you
fool!” He sped after his chum toward the house. “You
can’t do it, Dick!” But Dick paid no heed; it is doubtful
if he heard. Just before the porch stood the marshal with
warning hand outstretched.</p>

<p>“Here, get back there! You can’t go in.” Dick tried
to rush by, but the officer seized him and held him firmly.
Trevor came up panting. Dick viewed the marshal with
angry eyes.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” he said fiercely. “There’s a boy upstairs!
He’ll be burned up, you fool!”</p>

<p>“A boy up there?” repeated the marshal doubtingly.
“How do you know?” He eased his grip on Dick’s shoulder.
Like a flash the latter shook off the hand, seized the
astounded officer about the neck, and with a quick jerk
sent him sprawling, face down, on the gravel path. “Tell
them to put up ladders!” he shouted to Trevor, and with a
bound was up the steps and had entered the doorway.</p>

<p>“Dick! Dick, come back!” shrieked Trevor. Through
the murk of smoke the edge of the staircase was outlined in
writhing flames, and for an instant Trevor caught sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Dick half-way up it. With a sob Trevor leaped toward the
porch. But a strong hand seized him and brought him
tumbling back to the ground.</p>

<p>“One of you’ll do,” said the marshal’s voice in his ear.
“No use in your both being burned up.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll be killed!” cried Trevor, striking out savagely
at his captor. “Let me go, you—you brute! Can’t
you understand? Dick will be killed!” But he was forced,
struggling, gasping, sobbing, down the walk.</p>

<p>“Barnes!” bellowed the marshal’s voice, “there’s a
boy up there. This youngster will tell you about it. Get
your ladder quick!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>AND EXTORTS A PROMISE</small></h2>


<p>The heat was awful. At the turn in the staircase Dick
faltered and leaned against the wall. His eyes were smarting
with the acrid smoke; he could scarcely breathe. Below
him the door of the first-floor room to the left was crackling
savagely, the flames showing strangely red through the
eddying, rolling banks of smoke. Above him the stairs
were outlined with tiny tongues of fire or crimson patches
of smoldering woodwork, and beyond all was dark, foul
with the fumes which had poured up from the floor below.
The stairs under his feet grew hot, and the wall against
which he leaned a hand was like a pave on which a summer
sun has beaten for hours.</p>

<p>His first thought had been to find a fireman and lead
him to Taylor’s room, which was on the back of the house,
next to that in which the fire was eating rapidly from below.
But as yet he had seen no one. From the first floor
came dull blows of axes tearing into the timbers and plaster.
Should he go down again and summon help? But
no, for scarce a dozen steps intervened between him and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
door of Taylor’s room. If the ladders were being brought
to the window his task would prove simple, and might be
finished ere assistance could be found. And even as he
hesitated there, striving to protect his aching eyes with one
arm, the matter was decided for him. With a sound like
that of a mighty wave breaking upon a pebble-strewn beach
the fire broke through the door below, crumpling it up like
a sheet of metal foil and hurling it upward in a blast of
flaring cinders. Great tongues of flame burst forth into the
hallway as from the mouth of a giant furnace, and as he
looked the stairs behind him caught like tinder, and a
breath, scorching, suffocating, rushed up, seeming to take
him bodily from his feet and hurl him upon the smoking
steps above.</p>

<p>With a gasp, he struggled to his feet and fought blindly
up the remaining stairs. His escape by the front of the
house was cut off. And then for the first time the possibility
of finding Taylor’s door locked from within faced
him. If it should be so then his work was all in vain, for
he had no hope of being able to force the lock there in that
deadening swirl of smoke. From the head of the stairs to
the door of the room occupied by Taylor was but a half
dozen feet, but Dick, with his sleeve pressed against his
mouth and his eyes fast closed, won it only after what
seemed ages, though from the moment he had entered the
house until his groping fingers closed on the knob but a
scant minute had passed. Half sick with the fear that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
would find the door fast, he hesitated a second; and then,
with a stifled sob, turned the handle.</p>

<p>The door opened, a flood of cooler air met him, and in
a moment he had staggered inside and had closed the door
again. At first he could see nothing, for the room was in
darkness save for the little light that found its way through
the window on the side of the house, and his streaming
eyes hurt him terribly. He took a dozen deep inhalations
of the air, which, while heavy with the fumes from the
adjoining room, was pure indeed compared with that scorching,
smarting breath without. Then he raised his voice.</p>

<p>“Taylor!” he called, and then louder, “Taylor!
Taylor!”</p>

<p>There was no sound save the roar of the fire, the subdued
noise of the shouting crowd in the street, and now and
then the crash of a falling timber. He peered rapidly
about him, striving in the strange ruddy half-light that rose
and fell over the room to descry the object of his search.
There was the bed and here, nearer at hand, the square
table; beyond that was the armchair. Perhaps—— He
crossed the room quickly toward it, stumbled over some
obstruction, and fell to his knees on the carpet. With a
leaping heart he turned. There was a crash of falling
woodwork outside, and for an instant the room was bright
with the light of the flames. And in that instant he saw
that he was bending over the outstretched body of Roy
Taylor, lying face down by the table, one arm curved under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the head, the other stretched forth with fingers that
clutched blindly in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Taylor!” Dick stooped and raised the apparently
lifeless body into a sitting posture. “Taylor!” he cried
again, a dreadful fear clutching at his heart. To his joy the
form stirred and a groan reached his ears.</p>

<p>“Taylor! Brace up! You’re all right; do you hear
me?”</p>

<p>A muttered word, low, indistinguishable, answered his
appeal. He looked toward the half-opened window. Surely
the ladders would be there in a moment! The smoke
poured through under the door and wherever there was a
crevice, and momentarily increased in volume. Dick’s eyes
and lungs again gave the alarm. He shook Taylor with
a sudden impulse of terror.</p>

<p>“Wake up, you fool!” he cried. “Get on your feet,
or I’ll leave you here! Do you hear? I’ll leave you alone
if you don’t wake up!”</p>

<p>Suddenly an arm clutched itself about his shoulders and
he knew that Taylor heard him. Then, “Save me!” cried
a voice weak and hoarse from terror. “Get me out, oh,
get me out! Don’t leave me!”</p>

<p>“Well, keep awake, do you hear? Can you walk?”
There was no answer, but Dick could feel the other’s body
shaking with sobs. “Cut that out!” he said savagely.
“Brace up, man. Try to crawl to the window. I’ll help
you. Let go my arm, hang you! Let go, do you hear?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
With strong fingers he broke the detaining clutch and half
lifted the other to his feet. “Come on; get to the window;
they’re bringing ladders!” But Taylor, weakened by
his long period in bed, unmanned by his awful experience
alone and well-nigh helpless in the burning house, was incapable
of standing. With a rush of pity, Dick let him
slide toward the floor, until by stooping and moving backward
he could pull him by the shoulders across the room.
There was no time to consider the injured knee. The room
was filled with smoke; the heat was becoming intolerable;
in the hall just outside the door the flames were crackling
noisily, and to the left the plaster was breaking and falling
under the heat of the fire in the adjoining apartment. At
the window Dick propped Taylor against the wall and threw
up the sash. Outside all was light as day toward the front
of the house. He could see figures moving to and fro, could
hear the cries of the fire-fighters, but no ladders were in
sight. Below the lawn was some twenty feet distant. He
could drop if he had to with some hope of escaping anything
worse than a bad jar. But Taylor?</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he leaned there with the cool night air
driving by him, he asked himself why he should have risked
his life for Roy Taylor. Why continue to risk it? Of all
fellows in the school Taylor was the last to deserve consideration,
much less sacrifice, from him. He would wait
as long as he could without endangering his life, he told
himself, and then he’d drop from the window. And Taylor?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Taylor was nothing to him; he deserved no help from
him; he had injured him all that he could. Taylor must
look to himself!</p>

<p>And yet as the thoughts rushed through his mind, he
knew deep down somewhere within him that they were all
wrong, and knew that though the ladders never came he
would not leave the youth that sat shaking, terrified beside
him.</p>

<p>“But they must come!” he muttered. And leaning
out he called at the top of his voice for help. And then,
around the corner of the house, from the back, rushed two
figures and stared upward at him. They waved their hands
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Keep up! The ladder’s coming! Can you hold out
a minute?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Dick.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first temptation, as feeble as it had proved,
had paved the way and weakened his conscience for that
which now assailed him.</p>

<p>“At least make him pay for it!” whispered a voice.
“It is worth anything you can ask. Remember how he has
injured you. Make your bargain!”</p>

<p>He turned suddenly toward the lolling figure.</p>

<p>“Taylor, do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the answer, weak and trembling.</p>

<p>“Do you know who I am?” There was no reply.</p>

<p>“I’m Hope!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>An instance of silence followed. Then, “Hope!” came
a whisper, low, incredulous.</p>

<p>“Yes. Listen. I can save you if—if I want to. Are
you listening?” Outside were many voices on the lawn
under the casement.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Save me, Hope, save me!”</p>

<p>“I will on one condition,” whispered Dick hoarsely,
hating himself, despising himself from the bottom of his
heart, yet hurrying on with his words. “The bargain you
made is done with; do you understand? I’ll not give up the
captaincy, Taylor, but you must promise to come back as
you said you would, and help all you know how. You must
promise this, and you must keep your promise!”</p>

<p>A ladder scraped against the boards outside, rattled
once, and was still. A voice called: “Hurry! He was
there a moment ago; we saw him! He can’t be far away!
Look, the fire’s got through!” And as the words reached
him Dick heard the sound of falling mortar, of crackling
woodwork, and a great glare smote his eyes and an awful
heat surged toward him, making him stagger and gasp for
breath. The wall dividing the room from the front apartment
was at last conquered, and the flames leaped through
the breach, writhing, eager for their prey. For a moment
terror seized Dick, and he could only stare in horror toward
the groping tongues that scorched his face and dried
the breath in his nostrils. Then, stooping quickly, he lifted
Taylor’s body to the sill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#image01">“Your promise!” he cried. “Quick!”</a></p>

<p>“Yes, yes! For God’s sake, Hope! Anything! Oh,
it’s too late, too late!”</p>

<p>The ravening flames poured toward them, clutching at
them with greedy arms. A form darkened the window
and a voice cried:</p>

<p>“Lift him out! Easy! That’s right; can you get
down?”</p>

<p>“I—I think so,” muttered Dick, fighting down the
desire to let himself go and fall in a heap across the sill.</p>

<p>“Get onto the ladder, quick, and stay there! I’ll get
you out of here in a second. Here, Gus, take this chap; I
guess he’s fainted.” The fireman lowered himself down a
few rungs, clutching Taylor’s limp form, and Dick squirmed
unsteadily onto the ladder. There he held tightly and
closed his eyes. The room was red with roaring, seething
flames, but to him it seemed all a vast darkness. From
below—or was it not rather from miles away?—came a
long cheer; died away; increased again. And then Dick
felt arms about him.</p>

<p>“Keep your head now, sir, and put your arms around
my neck.” Dick obeyed as in a dream. He felt himself
descending—down—down—down——</p>

<p>And then his head fell forward and he fainted.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes he found himself lying on the
grass across the village street. The world was very strange,
crimson and yellow, and the trees threw great wavering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
shadows against the sky above. Some one was holding
something to his lips, and he drank because that seemed
the natural thing to do. Then a recollection of it all came
back, and he tried to sit up.</p>

<p>“Lie still,” said a voice. Dick looked. It was Malcolm
Kirk. And beside him was Trevor, looking absurdly
like a red Indian in the queer light. And there was Professor
Longworth, and somebody he didn’t know, and, oh,
lots of other persons! It was really very silly for them to
all stand around like that, and——</p>

<p>“Where’s Taylor?” he asked suddenly in a voice that
caused him to wonder whether it was really his, so weak
and husky was it.</p>

<p>“Taylor’s all right,” answered Kirk cheerfully.
“They’ve taken him to Hamment’s. How do you feel
now?”</p>

<p>“Kind of funny; I guess I’m sleepy; I guess I’ll go
home.”</p>

<p>“You’re going in a minute; they’re bringing a carriage.”</p>

<p>Dick started up wildly, clutching at Kirk’s arm.</p>

<p>“Is—is anything wrong with me?” he whispered
hoarsely. “Have I broken my leg, or—or anything?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not. Only you’re rather weak, you
know. We’re going to take you back in a carriage so you
won’t have to walk.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” He sank back again. Then he whispered: “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
can’t have anything the matter with me, you know, because
there’s the crew, you see. We have to think of that.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Kirk very, very gravely,
“there’s the crew. And here’s the carriage. And to prove
to you that you’re all right I’ll let you walk over to it.
Bear a hand, Nesbitt.”</p>

<p>Dick was raised to his feet, and to his great relief
found that he could walk well enough, if a trifle unsteadily,
and so reached the carriage and sank into the seat. Trevor
took his place beside him, and Kirk sat by the driver, and
they whirled away. Back of them the flames were still
leaping heavenward, flooding the sky with a crimson radiance
as they entered the academy gate.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” whispered Trevor.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so; kind of tired. I was a silly chump
to go and faint that way.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” answered Trevor vehemently. “You—you’re
a blooming hero, Dick, that’s what you are!”</p>

<p>And for reply Dick only shut his eyes and leaned away
from his chum.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>A DISAPPOINTING HERO</small></h2>


<p>Dick was a hero. Every one said so; and “every one”
certainly ought to have known. His advent at chapel the
morning following the fire was the signal for an outburst of
applause, a token of approval the like of which had not
occurred at Hillton since that far-famed half-back, Joel
March, was a student there and had rescued a lad from
drowning in the river. Yes, Dick was a hero. Professor
Wheeler sent for him and said all kinds of nice things, and
the resident instructor, Professor Tompkins, waylaid him
in the lower hall of Masters and beamed on him over his
glasses, and other members of the Faculty shook hands with
him warmly and quoted appropriate things in Greek and
Latin, and the students played the part of a monotonous
chorus and whispered when he passed.</p>

<p>But if Dick was a hero, his conception of the role was
all wrong, judged by the accepted standard. Instead of
wearing an expression of modest pride, instead of receiving
the tributes of an admiring public with blushes and murmured
expostulations as, of course, every hero has done
since the time of Adam, he mooned around out-of-the-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
corners like a bear with a sore head, while his most gracious
response to the admiring public was a muttered “Oh, dry
up, will you?” delivered in something between a growl and
a groan.</p>

<p>“You’re absolutely the most disappointing hero I ever
heard of!” said Trevor in disgust. “Why, if I’d done a
thing like that I’d be strutting around the yard with my
head back and my thumbs in my waistcoat pockets! A
chap would think you were grouchy about it!” Whereupon
Dick turned angrily:</p>

<p>“Trevor, if you don’t shut up I’ll pound you good and
hard! Now, I mean what I say!”</p>

<p>“Some are born to greatness,” murmured Trevor,
“some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust
upon them—and are exceeding wroth. I have spoken!”
And having spoken, he bolted out the door a fraction of a
second ahead of a German dictionary thrown with much
vigor and precision.</p>

<p>But, despite Dick’s displeasure, there was both truth and
justice in Trevor’s charge. Dick was disappointing. And
the school at large marveled, and finding that their admiration
for the plucky rescue was not wanted, thereafter
refrained from further mention of the matter in Dick’s
presence. And that youth kept to his room a good deal,
where, instead of delving in his books, he sat glowering
into space, or walked restlessly around like a caged lion.
He became extremely taciturn, and even rowing affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
failed to arouse any but the most indifferent replies. Trevor
wondered and grew alarmed.</p>

<p>By the burning of Coolidge’s house—due to the upsetting
and subsequent explosion of a patent non-explosive
lamp—seven boys found themselves homeless and less
about everything save the scanty wardrobes in which
they had made their escapes. Coolidge’s was a mere pile
of ashes and charred timbers. For the family charity was
unnecessary, since the house and contents had been well
insured, but for the boys who had lost almost everything a
scheme was speedily set on foot. A meeting was held in
Society House, and the president of the senior class, Wallace
Osgood, made a stirring address, which every one applauded,
and then asked for suggestions as to a means of
raising money to reimburse, to some extent at least, the victims
of the fire. There was no response until Malcolm
Kirk, who, with several members of the Faculty, presided
on the stage, moved that an amateur performance, the exact
character of which was to be later decided upon, be
given in the Town Hall. He was sure, he said, that there
was enough talent in the school to afford an interesting
program, and believed that enough tickets could be sold
at the academy and in the village to more than fill the hall.
The plan met with instant favor; Professor Wheeler indorsed
it, and moved that Mr. Kirk be asked to assume
charge of it; Mr. Kirk assented and moved, in turn, that
committees to work with him be appointed from the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
classes; the classes made their appointments on the spot;
a Saturday night some two weeks distant was chosen as the
date of the entertainment, and the meeting broke up with
great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Boys hurried to their rooms, and brought down dusty
banjos, guitars, and mandolins, and for nights afterward the
dormitories were made hideous with chromatic scales and
strange, weird chords. Dick found himself one of the
senior committee, and throwing aside some of his lethargy
worked busily with the rest. The first meeting of the joint
committee of arrangements was held in Kirk’s room the following
evening, and he outlined his plan. There was not,
he thought, sufficient time before the date agreed upon in
which to find performers for and rehearse anything in the
way of a play. Instead, he would suggest that scenes from
some well-known book be presented, each carrying only
enough dialogue to make themselves clear. For instance,
there was Tom Brown at Rugby; that afforded numerous
opportunities for interesting stage pictures; there was Tom’s
leave-taking with his father at the inn, in which the father’s
excellent advice would, he thought, appeal to the risibilities
of the audience. And then there was the fight with “Slogger”
Williams, the hazing scene before the fireplace, and
so on through the book. For the first part of the entertainment
he suggested that the musical talent of the school
could be levied upon; some of the fellows could undoubtedly
sing; many could perform on some instrument or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
other; perhaps some could give recitations; and no doubt
the band would do its share. For a further attraction, to
constitute a third part of the program, Kirk suggested
a series of representations of various sports, each to be pictured
by a single person in appropriate costume—as Football,
Baseball, Bowing, Lacrosse, Cricket, Hockey, Basketball,
Skating, Tobogganing, Snow-shoeing, Tennis, and so
on, all to be grouped together on the stage afterward for
a final tableau.</p>

<p>The plan was adopted, and for the next two weeks every
one was very busy, Kirk and Dick especially, since rowing
affairs claimed more and more of their attention every day.
May had brought fine, clear weather and sunny skies, under
which it was a pleasure to work. The little chilling breezes
that had been ruffling the blue waters of the Hudson had
crept away in the track of winter, and the valley was green
with fresh verdure and warm with the spring sunshine.
Each day brought fresh hope to those who were interested
in the success of the crew. The eight members of the
varsity worked together with something approaching accord,
and even Taylor’s continued absence from the boat
was no longer a reason for constant dismay; for Jones, by
dint of eternal vigilance and much tongue-lashing, had at
last made of himself a fairly acceptable Number 7. Taylor
was still laid up, for the fire and his efforts to fight his
way from the building before Dick’s arrival had set back
his recovery at least a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Many times Waters had brought word to Dick that
Taylor had asked to see him, and Dick had as many times
answered that he would go over to Waters’s room as soon
as he found time. But he took good care never to allow
himself opportunity. Trevor told him he was a brute.
Dick growled.</p>

<p>On the Saturday afternoon preceding the entertainment
the varsity and second crews met for their first tussle
on the water, and the result was surprising even to the varsity.
The two boats raced from the down-stream end of
Long Isle up the river for a half mile, and the varsity’s
victory was too decisive to allow of its being explained by
crediting the second with unusually slow work. In fact,
even the second made favorable time for the course, while
the varsity, which finished twelve lengths to the good, came
within a few seconds of equaling the best record. But this
was a fact known only to Kirk, Dick, and Keene, for the
former pointed out dryly that it wouldn’t do them any
harm if their rivals at Marshall continued to believe them
in poor shape. “It may lead to overconfidence on St. Eustace’s
part,” said Kirk, “and overconfidence is usually a
winning card—for the other side.”</p>

<p>But, despite the brightening prospects, Dick was not
happy. In fact, he didn’t remember of ever having been
so utterly miserable and out of humor with himself. He
didn’t pretend to misunderstand the cause; he was, he told
himself savagely, at least honest with Dick Hope, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
how much of a scoundrel he was in reality. He knew that
if he went to Roy Taylor like a man and absolved him from
the promise so villainously extorted, he would, in a measure
at least, recover his self-respect. He tried at first to
justify his conduct to himself by craftily pointing out the
fact that he had used Taylor’s own weapons; that if Taylor
had not acted like a thief there would have been no call for
Dick to act like one; and that, when the matter was observed
dispassionately, he had only taken advantage of his
opportunity to work for the good of the crew and the
school. But the pose of disinterested public benefactor
didn’t satisfy him, and, although he ground his teeth and
knit his brows and doggedly determined to hold on to the
vantage he had gained, he was not happy, but, on the contrary,
loathed himself heartily, hated Trevor because that
youth insisted upon thinking him a high-minded hero, detested
Taylor because the latter was primarily to blame for
it all, and lost his appetite, didn’t half know his lessons, and
was, in short, at odds with the whole world.</p>

<p>And then came the night of the benefit performance in
the Town Hall. St. Eustace had subscribed for fifty tickets
at a dollar apiece, and had then returned them to the committee
to be resold. As a result of this, and of the activity
of the class ticket-sellers, the hall on the night of the entertainment
was altogether too small for the purpose. The
villagers had responded generously to the appeal, and had
bought seats until it had begun to look as though there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
would be no places left for the students. But every one in
the end managed to squeeze in somehow; and as every member
of the audience, whether he saw the performance from
a comfortable seat in the front of the hall or only caught
an occasional glimpse of it from behind a wall of less fortunate
persons, paid a dollar for the privilege; and as the
expenses were almost nil, the exchequer when the curtain
went up held the very satisfactory total of $354, a fraction
over $50 for each of the fire victims.</p>

<p>There is not space enough here to do justice to the excellency
of the program. It will serve to say that some
twenty boys sang, played on a marvelous variety of instruments,
from accordion to piano, and recited. Williams
gave operatic selections on a zither, and for encore rendered
Way Down Upon the Suwanee River; a youth named Billings
sang Massa’s in the Cold, Cold Ground, not so much
because it was intensely musical as because it was about
the only thing that accommodated itself to his voice; Todd
sat down in a straight-backed chair at the front of the stage
and did all kinds of stunts on a banjo, which pleased his
audience vastly; Osgood sang The New Bully in a manner
that sent the younger boys into spasms of laughter; Trevor,
attired in hastily improvised costume, sang a number of
coster songs in a sweet tenor, and gained much applause;
Jones recited the tragic termination of the baseball career
of one named Casey; and so it went. And when Part First
had come to an end the stage was set for the first of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Scenes from Tom Brown at Rugby, and it fell to Dick, as
his contribution to the evening’s entertainment, to go before
the curtain and explain what was to follow. His appearance
was greeted with the heartiest applause that had
thus far fallen to the lot of any. The audience was in good
humor, Dick was a hero, and here was an opportunity to
show approval of the gallant rescuer. The boys cheered,
the villagers clapped and stamped applause, the less polite
members of the community that fringed the gathering
yelled vociferously, and Dick—well, he did a most unaccountable
thing: he grew pale, faltered, and even turned
toward the wing as though meditating escape. “Such modesty!”
breathed a kind-hearted lady in the second row.
But after the first impulse toward flight Dick waited for
silence, white-faced, unsmiling, and when it came made
his speech calmly, in well-modulated but unenthusiastic
voice, bowing himself off finally under a second bombardment
of applause. Then the curtain arose on Tom Brown
and his father in the tap-room of the inn. Mr. Brown, Sr.,
impersonated by Crocker of the varsity crew, was a hale and
hearty country squire in wig, long coat, and top-boots;
while a small junior, in ridiculous long trousers and chimney-pot
hat, made up excellently as a rather nervous Tom.
Crocker delivered his speech of advice in a manner that
captured the audience, Boots appeared at the door to announce
that the stage-coach was waiting and the curtain descended
amid applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick, however, saw nothing of this. Having gained the
wings he seized his hat from a chair, and, unobserved, made
his way out of the door into the rear hall, clattered down
the stairs and into the darkness. From the brightly lighted
building came the sound of clapping hands and laughter;
ahead the village street stretched in semidarkness. A yellow
gaslight flared at each corner of the little triangle
known as The Park. Dick almost ran. As he passed Watson’s
stables a challenging bark told him that Muggins had
heard his footsteps. On the next corner stood Bradford’s
boarding-house. Dick found the front door unlocked, and
after a moment’s hesitation climbed the stairs. On the
landing above five portals confronted him, but from under
only one of them did any light shine. He knocked. A voice
bade him enter. Obeying, he found himself in a long, low-studded
room, handsomely, almost luxuriously furnished.
On a broad couch under the strong light of a big bronze
lamp, a book in his hand and his listless eyes turned inquiringly
toward the door, lay Roy Taylor.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>TAYLOR ACCEPTS DEFEAT</small></h2>


<p>“Hello, Hope!”</p>

<p>Taylor raised himself and stared wonderingly at the
visitor. His pale cheeks flushed and an unaccustomed embarrassment
seized upon him. “Sit down,” he continued.
“I—I’d given up looking for you.”</p>

<p>Dick tossed his cap on the table, and drew a chair to
a position near the couch. His face, too, was pale, but there
was no sign of embarrassment visible; only a strong determination
was indicated by the little creases in his forehead
and the sudden squaring of his jaw. He launched
into the subject of his visit abruptly.</p>

<p>“I came over because I’m sick of this business, Taylor.
Look here, I acted like a brute and a contemptible
cad the other night; I knew it then; I don’t know what got
into me. I’ve tried to stick it out, but it’s no good.”</p>

<p>Taylor was gazing at him with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, Taylor, for taking advantage of
you—of your position that night, and I want you to say
that you forgive me. The promise you made—rather, the
promise I forced from you—doesn’t hold. I’m going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
resign the captaincy to-morrow, and it’s yours as soon as
you want it, as far as I’m concerned.” He paused and
looked intently at Taylor. The latter gave a little embarrassed
laugh, and dropped his eyes to the book beside
him.</p>

<p>“I think you’re talking a good deal of nonsense, Hope,”
he answered finally. “But if you want me to say that I
forgive you, why, that’s all right. I can’t see that there’s
anything to forgive. You simply turned the tables on me
when you had the chance; you’d been a silly ass if you
hadn’t. And, anyhow, I don’t see that there is anything
to forgive when a chap saves your life. It may sound
rather funny for me to be thanking you and all that, after
we’ve been rowing as we have, and maybe you don’t want
my thanks, but, of course, I’m—I’m awfully grateful. It
was a jolly brave thing to do, though I don’t pretend to
know why you did it. I thought until a minute ago that—that
you’d seen your chance of turning the tables and
took advantage of it, but——”</p>

<p>“You mean you thought I started to get you out simply
so that I could bully you into releasing me from my
promise?” asked Dick, with a tremble in his voice.</p>

<p>Taylor glanced up hurriedly, dropped his gaze again,
and went on quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, that was natural, wasn’t it? But I see now that
it wasn’t so. Anyway, I’m awfully much obliged to you. I
told Waters to ask you to come and see me half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
times; I wanted to say this before; but I guess you didn’t
care to see me.”</p>

<p>“I was pretty busy,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t blame you. I dare say I wouldn’t have
come if I’d been in your place. After what I’ve been up
to, you know. But that—well, that’s over with now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dick, “that’s done with. We won’t
say any more about it; just forget it; goodness knows, I
don’t want to remember it. It made me act like a regular
beast; I’ve been hating myself ever since; I’ve been
ashamed to look any one in the face! After all, it’s only
the success of the boat I want, Taylor, and I believe you’ll
work for that. If I thought you wouldn’t——” He
paused and looked at the other with an ugly glint in his
eyes. “But I think you will. When can you take hold?”</p>

<p>“You’re making a mistake, Hope,” answered Taylor,
with the suggestion of his old mocking smile visible. “I’ve
had lots of time for thinking things over lately. Lying here
like this a chap has to think a good deal. Well, I said it
was all over with. What I meant was my captaincy scheme.
I’m beaten; I’ll acknowledge it; not beaten altogether by
you, though, Hope. Luck or Fate or something had a
hand in it. You and I don’t look at things in just the
same way; I know you wouldn’t have done what I’ve done
to get a dozen captaincies; I dare say there’s something in
the way you’re brought up. I sort of brought myself up,
you know. I rather imagine having a mother and father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and living with, them makes a difference; I never had
either—that is, since I can remember. But you don’t care
about all that, I guess. I wanted the captaincy, and I set
out to get it, using whatever means I could find. It wasn’t
square; I’ll acknowledge that. I never tried to make
myself believe that it was. I’d managed to get what I was
after, it seemed, when luck, or—well, whatever you like to
call it—cut in. Then I had that fall. I suspected then that
it was all up. I dare say I’m a little superstitious. When
the fire came and you turned up in the nick of time I
knew that luck was against me. I expected you to make
that bargain, Hope; you see, it was just what I’d have done
in your place. When I got to the window I thought for
a minute that you’d lose your chance; I was calling you a
fool; and all the time I was scared blue. I don’t believe
I’m more of a coward than the next chap, but that five
minutes or five years before you came was awful!” He
stopped and a shudder passed over him. “Well, you seized
your chance. You say now that that promise doesn’t hold,
but it does hold. Oh, yes, it holds good and fast for all time,
Hope.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t!” cried Dick. “I won’t have it!”</p>

<p>“But it does,” replied Taylor calmly. “And even if
it didn’t, it wouldn’t make any difference about the captaincy.
I may be built somewhat different from you, but
I’ve got some principles. They may be queer ones, but I
won’t fight a fellow that has saved my life. That settles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
it. I’ll stick to that promise, just as you would have stuck
to yours. I’ll go back to work on the crew just as soon as
the doctor lets me, which will likely be next week, and I’ll
do my level best.”</p>

<p>Taylor lay back on the cushions looking rather tired
and pale, and Dick got up and wandered restlessly about
the room for a minute. It was all so different from what
he had looked forward to that he found himself incapable
of deciding whether the course Taylor insisted upon was
right or wrong. It was so easy that it somehow appeared as
though it must be wrong. He was to keep the captaincy,
Taylor was to return to the boat, the whole episode was to be
closed; in short, he was to reap the benefit of his dishonest
deed without suffering punishment. Although, he reflected
the next moment, perhaps he had been suffering the punishment
the last two weeks!</p>

<p>“But just the same,” he said aloud, “it doesn’t seem
right.”</p>

<p>“That’s your New England conscience,” mocked Taylor.
“You think that because a thing didn’t break your
back in the doing it can’t be anything but an invention of
the devil’s. I may have an easier morality than you, Hope;
but, thank Heaven, I wasn’t born in New England!”</p>

<p>Dick stared at him.</p>

<p>“But, see here, Taylor, if I agree to this——”</p>

<p>“You can’t do anything else.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you will—will be satisfied?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Probably not; and yet, I don’t know; I’m rather sick
of it; this being laid up like a blasted mummy takes the
pluck out of a fellow. Maybe”—he smiled quizzically—“maybe
it takes some of the meanness out, too. Anyhow,
I’ll keep to the promise. And if that silly conscience of
yours is still grumbling, why, choke it off. You’ve done
right enough; you’ve done more than I’d have done;
though, of course, that doesn’t signify much. You slipped
up for the minute, and now you are sorry. As far as I’m
concerned, I forgive you, although, as I said before, I don’t
see that I’ve anything to forgive.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never forgive myself,” said Dick, with conviction.</p>

<p>Taylor shrugged his shoulders and moved his head as
though weary of the subject.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to settle that with yourself; I dare say
you’ll be fighting it out for the next ten years.”</p>

<p>Dick took up his cap, hesitated an instant, and then
strode to the couch.</p>

<p>“Mind shaking hands?” he asked.</p>

<p>Taylor grinned.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” he asked. “It won’t make things
any better or any worse.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather, if you don’t mind,” replied Dick gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.” Taylor put out his, and the two lads
clasped hands silently.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Dick, turning away. “I hope you’ll
get well soon and come and help us. We need you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night,” answered Taylor. “I dare say I’ll be
out by the last of the week. You’re not a half bad sort,
Hope; if it wasn’t for that bothersome conscience of yours
I think we might get on together fairly well.”</p>

<p>Dick’s last glance across the room showed him a pallid,
tired-looking youth sitting on the edge of the couch, with
dejection expressed in his attitude, but a mocking smile
on his face.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>PROSPECTS OF VICTORY</small></h2>


<p>The erstwhile gallant crew of The Sleet lay upon the
grass in front of Academy Building in the shadow thrown
by the wall that runs along the edge of the bluff. About
them in little piles lay various worn and tattered books.
Dick and Carl, propped upon their elbows, were nibbling
the succulent ends of grass blades. Trevor lay flat upon
his back, gazing steadfastly upward at the slowly marching
clouds, supreme content upon his sunburned face.
Stewart Earle sat cross-legged and performed wonderful
feats with a pearl-handled penknife. It was a few minutes
before two; dinner was over and the bell had not yet rung
for recitations.</p>

<p>Before them the warm red bulk of Academy Building,
already hidden in wide expanses with tender green ivy
leaves, arose against the velvety blue of the sky. In the
tower a quivering disk of dazzling light marked where the
sun shone upon the old bell. The trees were in full leaf,
and the green was a little forest of light and shade and murmurous
branches. Even the river dozed, below the bluff turquoise
blue unbroken by swirl or eddy, beyond in the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
aglint with the sun. In the dormitories the windows
were thrown wide, and boys lazed on the cushioned seats.
There was a tuneful, unceasing hum of insects; the sun shone
hotly; summer had come to the valley of the Hudson. It
was the third day of June, a fact just remarked upon by
Stewart, who had casually added that it was the anniversary
of the Battle of Cold Harbor. This exciting announcement
went unnoticed for a moment. Then Carl
yawned loudly.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe it,” he muttered. More silence followed.
Then, “It is extremely bad taste,” said Dick, “to
air your knowledge in—that—in that——” Then his teeth
closed on an unusually attractive grass stem and he subsided.
A little breeze crept up the slope from the campus
and stirred the brown locks over Trevor’s forehead. He
sat up suddenly and observed Dick and Carl in fine disdain.</p>

<p>“Lazy beggars,” he muttered. At great labor and with
many harrowing groans he reached about and gathered a
handful of grass. Dick knew what was coming, but hadn’t
the energy to prepare for resistance until it was too late.
Then he sat up himself and, pulling the wad from his
neck, stuffed it down Carl’s. Every one giggled; it was
really very funny for a warm day. The quartet were now
sitting in a circle, even Carl showing signs of life. Conversation
appeared to be necessary. Dick opened his lips
and closed them again without a sound. Trevor came to
the rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hot,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“You’re an awful chatterbox,” sighed Carl. But the
spell was broken.</p>

<p>“Only two weeks to the end of school,” said Dick.
“By Jove, I’d just like to know where the time’s gone; it
doesn’t seem any time since spring vacation!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” answered Carl. “Another two weeks and
it’ll be all over, and good-by to old Hillton. It’s funny
how sorry it makes a chap. That’s the odd thing about it;
it doesn’t seem so fine until you have to leave it all. I
wonder if I’ll have as good a time at college?”</p>

<p>“I know,” mused Dick sentimentally, “it’s almost like
leaving home. I wish—I wish I was going to stay another
year!”</p>

<p>“My, you’re funny,” quoth Stewart. “Catch me being
sorry when I get through!”</p>

<p>“Wait; you will be,” answered Carl. “There’s a whole
raft of fellows going up to Harwell this year, isn’t there?
Do you know anything about your room yet, Dick?”</p>

<p>“No; I guess I’ll find a small one near the Yard for
this year. When Trevor comes he and I are going to room
together, aren’t we, old chap?”</p>

<p>“If you’re good,” answered his chum gravely. When
hostilities had ended Carl said reminiscently:</p>

<p>“It’s been a pretty good year for Hillton, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“So far; if you only beat St. Eustace at baseball, and
if we can only win on the river it’ll be the best year on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
record, I guess. We certainly did her up finely at the interscholastic
meet, eh?”</p>

<p>“I should say so! Forty-three points to twenty-nine!
And little Stew here to thank for ten of them. Take off
your hat, Stew!”</p>

<p>“’Tis off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget the way in which he ran away from
that St. Eustace fellow in the half-mile,” continued Carl,
smiling. “And to think that when he came here three
years ago he couldn’t turn the door-knob without using
both hands!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” said Stewart.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re pretty certain to beat St. Eustace at
baseball, aren’t you, Carl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty certain; barring accidents we ought to
have little trouble. We play Shrewsburg again Saturday,
and I believe we’ll shut her out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get too confident,” warned Dick.</p>

<p>“No fear; and I don’t talk like this before the fellows.
But we’ve really got the finest lot of players that I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“I know. Well, if you get both games from St. Eustace
your name will go down to posterity in red letters with a
wreath about it. I only wish I was as hopeful as you are.”</p>

<p>“Old Dick wouldn’t let himself get hopeful if we had a
boatful of tailor’s dummies to row against,” said Trevor.
“There isn’t any possibility of our getting beaten on the
fifteenth—barring accidents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the trouble is we can’t bar accidents,” replied
Dick. “They will happen even in the best regulated of
crews. Somebody’s certain to take sick or sprain his wrist
or something.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he an old granny?” asked Trevor disgustedly.</p>

<p>“I hear you had a shake-up yesterday?” queried Carl.</p>

<p>“A little one; Kirk took Milton out and is trying
Cheever at three. And he dropped Rankin from the second
eight. That was all. I guess we’ll row about the way
we are now. St. Eustace’s coach read the riot act last week,
they say; dumped two men out of the boat and raked every
one over the coals. Oh, well, we’ll know all about it in
a couple of weeks.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was as certain of exams as I am that we’ll
beat St. Eustace,” said Trevor. “By the way, Dick, the
pater’s coming up for class day to see you graduate. Stewart,
they’re going to draw for the tennis tournament to-night
in Chandler’s room.”</p>

<p>“How many entries are there?” asked Carl.</p>

<p>“Twenty-two. I hope I don’t get drawn for the preliminary
round, that’s all. I’d hate to get thrown out of it so
early and have no——”</p>

<p>“There she goes,” said Stewart, jumping up.</p>

<p>The bell in the tower rang lazily, and the four entered
Academy Building for two o’clock recitations.</p>

<p>May had slipped into June, and June had brought fresh
impetus in every outdoor pursuit. The school was rowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
mad, just as it always was in June, and every day groups of
fellows congregated at the boat-house or watched the proceedings
from the path above. The trying period of instruction
in a pair-oar at the hands of Malcolm Kirk or, as
upon occasions, at those of Dick, was over and practice had
simmered down to businesslike work in stretches of from an
hour to two hours each day. It wasn’t all rowing; often
the men leaned motionless over their oars while Kirk from
the deck of the little Terrible talked to them for a quarter
of an hour at a time on the error of their way. Always,
nowadays, there was ten minutes or so of practicing starts;
often the varsity and second were drawn up on the mark,
and were given the word together; and alas for the boat
that was behind at the tenth stroke! But it was the best
of training, and the proficiency in quick starting which they
finally secured stood them in good stead later.</p>

<p>There was less fault-finding on the part of the coach with
the fellows as individuals now. The work as a whole received
the bulk of his attention, and the most serious fault
he had to contend with was a tendency to raise the stroke
by rushing the body forward instead of putting more force
into the pull through. There were lesser faults, besides;
plenty of them; there was probably never yet a perfect
crew, and certainly Hillton’s varsity was in no danger of
becoming one. But on the whole the fellows rowed well,
making the most of the long stroke, taking kindly enough
to the rather severe leg-work, and gradually acquiring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
ability to spurt quickly and evenly. For this, naturally,
much credit belonged to Dick, who, at stroke, displayed
wonderful steadiness, and inspired the crew with a sensation
of balance and security that promised to accomplish much
in time of stress. Taylor, at Number 7, worked with
Dick as one cog-wheel works with another, and Kirk was
well satisfied with the stern of the varsity boat at least.
In the waist a source of some trial was Waters, who of late
had displayed a tendency to clip his stroke. Trevor was
doing finely at Number 4, and had vindicated Kirk’s first
impression of him, and Professor Beck’s as well, and, for
that matter, his own. But perhaps the best feature displayed
by the crew was a hearty willingness to work; there
were no sluggards in the boat, and an earnest resolve to
wrest victory from St. Eustace inspired all.</p>

<p>Taylor had kept his promise, though Dick, to be sure,
had never doubted that he would do so. In the course
of time the sprained knee was pronounced healed, and he
had taken his place in the boat again and had fitted into
it in such a way that Dick was convinced that his sacrifice,
had it been necessary, would not have been too dear a price
to pay for the other’s return. The two saw but little of
each other outside of training, and the trouble that had
threatened Hillton with defeat on the water was never
alluded to by either. If they were not friends neither were
they enemies, and each had risen in the other’s estimation.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>STEWART’S REVENGE</small></h2>


<p>The tennis tournament began two days after the pow-wow
between the quartet on the lawn. In spite of Trevor’s
wishes on the subject, he found himself drawn for the preliminary
round, and opposed to a lower middle boy named
Page. But he had no trouble in winning two sets running,
and so qualified for the finals.</p>

<p>The tournament went slowly, for those were busy days
at Hillton, and allowances had to be made for the demands
of crew and baseball training. But Friday night left only
four contestants—Trevor, Stewart, Hollis, and Montgomery.
Play in the semifinal round began early Saturday
morning. Trevor defeated Montgomery 3-6, 6-2, 6-2, and
Stewart won from Hollis 6-3, 7-5. After a half-hour’s rest
Trevor and Stewart faced each other smilingly across the
net in the final round to decide the school championship.</p>

<p>It was a perfect morning for tennis, bright and warm,
and though it gave promise of heat later, at ten o’clock a
soft, fresh breeze blew across the campus from the woods.
Trevor won the toss and chose the south court.</p>

<p>“I see my finish here,” he said with a grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Stewart laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’ve got you scared. How are you feeling?”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>“So’m I; so look out for yourself.”</p>

<p>Trevor’s fears appeared to be justified by events, for
Stewart took the first set from him very easily, six games
to three, and won the second after a somewhat harder
battle to the tune of 7-5. But after that Trevor seemingly
found himself, and the third encounter was brilliant enough
to win almost unceasing applause from the fairly large
throng of spectators. It went to him finally by six games
to four, and the fourth set begun.</p>

<p>The two boys played very different tennis. Trevor at
his best was supremely careful and painstaking; one might
have thought that tennis was a game like chess, in which
each stroke was the result of deep study. He played
slowly, relying upon scientific placing for his points. His
serve was a justly celebrated overhand cut which against
almost any boy in the school save his present opponent was
very dangerous. But Trevor and Stewart had played together
all the spring, and knew each other’s style from
A to Z, and Stewart had from long experience learned
to return Trevor’s puzzling service with a forehand stroke
off the ground that was almost always successful. Trevor
played well back as a rule, and was the possessor of a back-hand
return that was the admiration of all.</p>

<p>Stewart on the court was like a whirlwind in white flannels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
He was all dash and go. Lithe and lightly built, he
seemed capable of being everywhere at once, and that without
any special effort. His playing was brilliant in the
extreme; his service was a swift stroke that landed the ball
almost invariably on the service-line, and that required
the opponent to stand back of base-line to receive it; his
return was a long, lightning-like drive that just topped the
net; and his smashing was something terrific. But, like
most whirlwind players, Stewart took long risks and occasionally
got very wild.</p>

<p>The fourth set went to Trevor after a hard battle, eight
games to six, and the decisive struggle commenced. It was
Trevor’s serve, and for the first time during the contest he
won a love game on it, Stewart returning every ball out
of court. On Stewart’s service Trevor failed almost as
signally, getting but one return over. Stewart tried lobbing
in the next game with disastrous results, and Trevor
again won. With the games 1-3 Stewart took a decided
brace and secured the next on his service, and the following
one partly through Trevor’s poor work and partly
through fine handling of the puzzling serves. It was then
Trevor’s turn to win twice running, and he brought the
score to 3-4; Stewart by faultless service made it four
games all; each then won on his service and the score was
games all.</p>

<p>It had been decided that the final set should not be a
vantage set, and hence the next game would settle the contest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
The two lads changed courts, and the audience looked
for a speedy termination of the struggle. Trevor led off
with a fault and followed it with a poor serve that allowed
Stewart to return a slashing ball far into the right angle
of side- and base-lines. Trevor was too late, and amid the
applause of the crowd, and somewhat disconcerted, he repeated
his previous performance; the first ball went into
the net and the second bounced obligingly into Stewart’s
racket and came skimming back swift and low, touching
the canvas strip and dropping almost lifeless in the shadow
of the net. This was also lost to Trevor, and the score was
love-thirty. Trevor looked grimly determined now, and
Stewart watched sharply for the next serve. He found it
and returned it, and Trevor, with excellent judgment,
crouched out of its way and let it go by well out of court.
The next serve was one of Trevor’s best, and it found a
good big hole in his adversary’s racket. The score was
thirty all. Stewart found the next serve and put it into
Trevor’s hands; the latter cut it to the left of the opposite
court, but Stewart sent it back neatly toward the base-line.
Trevor reached it by a long run, and with a magnificent
back-hand stroke tried to place it over his opponent’s head.
But Stewart was watchful and alert, and ran back in time,
and again volleyed, sending the sphere down the right-side
line. Trevor again returned, seeking a place out of reach
of his nimble adversary, and Stewart, after a hard chase
across court, got it on the bound and played it gently over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Trevor had followed up, however, and it was all over on
the next play, for although Stewart dashed back again to
the territory he had just left unprotected the ball was dead
when he reached it. The score was now 40-30, and the
game, set, and match might be won on the next stroke.</p>

<p>Trevor was breathing hard, but there was a grim determination
in his eyes. Stewart appeared less tuckered, but
he was somewhat pale despite the easy smile that played
over his boyish face. Up went Trevor’s racket; up went
the ball. There was a line of white through the air; Stewart
put the head of his racket to the gravel; the ball in
its low rebound struck it fair and went hurtling back. Stewart
ran up to within a yard of the net. Trevor waited for
the bounce, glanced hurriedly over the opposite court, chose
his place, and sided his racket. But his plans were
wrecked by a pebble. Up went the ball on the rebound
almost straight into the air. Trevor darted forward.
There was no time for niceties of cutting or placing. Ball
and racket came together, and the former went skimming
forward, head-high, straight as a dart for Stewart’s
racket!</p>

<p>The crowd held its breath, picturing the terrific smash
to follow, and Trevor scuttled back to the rear of the
court from where it might be barely possible to get the ball
on its long rebound. Stewart swung his racket back,
strong fingers grasping the end of the handle, swung it
down with all his force—and stared in seeming amaze. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
groan of dismay went up from the onlookers as the ball
passed by untouched and dropped into court.</p>

<p>“Game and set and match!” called the umpire. And
then the applause began. Trevor advanced to the net, and
he and Stewart shook hands.</p>

<p>“Beastly luck, that last stroke,” said Trevor heartily.</p>

<p>“Rotten playing, you mean,” answered Stewart, smiling.
“I’m glad you’ve won, Trevor, honestly; but some
time you and I’ll have it out again, if you like.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’d like to. And there’s another tournament
coming next year, you know.”</p>

<p>Dick, who in company with Carl and many other
friends, had watched the match from the side-line, slapped
Trevor on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good work, chum! And you played like a cyclone,
Stewart; you ought to have had it.” Then Trevor took possession
of the little silver mug and wondered where the
engraver was going to find room for his name on it, and the
crowd broke up and hurried toward the Yard and dinner.
On the way Stewart found himself beside Dick. Trevor
and Todd were some distance ahead, the latter, who could
play tennis about as well as an elephant can jump rope, explaining
to the champion where he had made his mistakes.</p>

<p>“That was a queer stroke of yours, Stewart,” said Dick.</p>

<p>The younger boy darted a fleeting glance into the
other’s smiling face.</p>

<p>“Rotten, wasn’t it?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t call it rotten exactly; I should say
it was remarkable.”</p>

<p>Stewart again glanced up to find Dick looking at him
quizzically. For a moment the two eyed each other; then
Stewart laughed and Dick joined in.</p>

<p>“No more remarkable than the way in which Trevor
lost the two hundred and twenty yards at the indoor meeting,
was it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Dick. “I should say they were about
on a par. But I didn’t think that you suspected——”</p>

<p>“You must think I’m blind then. I knew it well
enough, and I made up my mind then to have my revenge.
And I’ve had it to-day. But, I say, Dick, I’d rather you
wouldn’t tell Trevor. I don’t think he knows.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t say a word to him,” replied Dick with a
smile. “You’re a funny pair, you two.”</p>

<p>But he went on up the river-path with one crimson-clad
arm over Stewart’s shoulders.</p>

<p>The week that intervened between the tournament and
the boat-race passed quickly. There was an air of expectancy
and excitement in the air. Examinations were approaching,
class day was almost at hand, and Hillton and
St. Eustace were about to match their prowess both on the
water and on the diamond. The varsity crew was on the
river twice daily, but the hardest of training was over, and
a period of light work took the place of the former grinding
labor. The time for sledge-hammer blows was past, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
efforts of coach, captain, and coxswain were directed toward
putting the finishing polish on their handiwork. From
Marshall came the news that St. Eustace’s head rowing
coach was firmly of the belief that he had succeeded in
turning out a crew no whit inferior to that of the preceding
year, and it was evident in many ways that the
backers of the Blue were confident of another victory.</p>

<p>Dick was himself again; contented, hard-working, even
hopeful despite his dark forebodings. He had not forgotten
his lapse from honor; he often spent miserable moments in
thinking about it; but, what with earnest promises to atone
for it and with work and study enough to occupy every
moment of his waking time, he found his periods of self-abasement
becoming fewer and fewer. He was certain
of passing his examinations well, and believed he would
graduate an honor man of three terms.</p>

<p>On Thursday he and Trevor and Muggins sat in the
grand stand and cheered nine clever young gentlemen on
to a decisive victory over the ball players of St. Eustace,
a victory that indicated a second to come when Hillton
played the last game of the series at Marshall the following
week. Gray was elated, and Hillton was proud of him, and
gave evidence of its pride by well-nigh raising the roof
when he appeared in dining-hall.</p>

<p>And after the game was over Dick and Trevor went
to training-table for the last time; and every one was very
hopeful and rather sad, and decidedly nervous—every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
save Kirk, who did most of the talking, and told strange
and interesting stories of life at Hillton when he was a boy
there. There had been no work on the river that day, for
the shell had been shipped to Marshall; but a two-mile trot
on the road, followed by a five-minute bout with the
weights, had taken the place of it. After supper the men
went to Society House, where the second crew, disbanded
the previous day, joined them, and Professor Beck and two
graduates spoke to them in earnest, hopeful strain until it
was bedtime. Then the varsity crew got together and
cheered long and loud for the second, and the second
cheered the varsity, and they both cheered Coach Kirk and
Professor Beck and the two graduates. Whereupon all
scattered for bed.</p>

<p>The next morning, bright and early, the varsity and
substitutes journeyed to Marshall, and at eleven o’clock
were paddling slowly over the course of the next day’s race,
watched here and there by groups of St. Eustacians. They
put up at the hotel, where Muggins, attired in a gorgeous
crimson blanket adorned on each side with a great white
H, attracted much interest, and afforded not a little amusement.
He knew every member of the crew and every substitute
by nightfall, and gave each a place in his affections.
And when, after dinner, the St. Eustace Glee and Mandolin
Clubs, followed by a number of boys from across the river,
put in an appearance and gave a concert on the veranda,
he planted his front feet wide apart, raised his blunt nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
toward the starlit sky, and howled loudly and dismally
until Trevor bore him off to bed.</p>

<p>And, although the concert still went on, Trevor did
not return to the veranda again. Something, perhaps the
excitement of the day, had given him a splitting headache
and a queer feeling all over that was difficult to define. So
he undressed, climbed into bed, and, cuddling Muggins
closely to him, fell off into a dream-troubled slumber.</p>

<p>Trevor read the tables and laid down the copy of the
Marshall Morning Reporter with a sigh and stared across
the little lawn at the village street. Muggins worried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
newspaper for a moment, and then, observing Trevor’s attitude,
cuddled up to him in sympathy, and thumped the
porch floor with what, had it been in his power, he would
have called his tail. The paper fluttered off across the
gravel driveway, and he cocked his ears, meditating pursuit;
but Trevor’s hand had now found his head; the sun was
warm; it was comforting to be rubbed; and so he only
blinked sleepily and sat quiet.</p>

<p>Saturday, the 15th of June, had dawned warm and
clear. Over the river a little blue mist hung until a strong
breeze swept across the water from the west, kicking up
quite a rumpus along the eastern shore. The town was
already well filled with visitors, among them not a few
graduates of Hillton and St. Eustace, who had arrived the
preceding evening. The quiet old village was decked in
holiday attire, and its shrewd innkeepers and merchants
were rubbing their hands in anticipation of the yearly harvest.</p>

<p>Three of the Hillton crew had complained at the breakfast
table that morning of having lame backs, while Talbot,
a substitute, was clearly out of the question, having
no appetite and not a little fever.</p>

<p>“I always said there was malaria in this place,” complained
Kirk, “it’s so low. We had some trouble last
year, do you remember, Hope? Benson was attacked with
fever, although it left him at noon and he was all right
again. That’s where St. Eustace has the better of us; she’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
used to this place, and we’re not. I believe it wouldn’t
be a half bad plan next year to leave coming here until
the morning of the race.”</p>

<p>And Trevor, sitting on the edge of the porch, engaged
with Muggins’s ears, heard and was comforted. He had
awoke that morning after an unrefreshing sleep with a most
uncomfortable sensation of goneness and a bewildering
heaviness in his head. His eyes seemed tired, as though he
had been reading long and hard, his lips were parched, and
as the morning went on a feeling of feverishness alarmed
him. At breakfast he had forced himself to eat, much
against the inclination of his stomach, for fear that Kirk
would perceive his condition and keep him out of the boat.
He was not used to illness, and was inclined to attribute
his unpleasant condition to nervousness. And now Kirk’s
words encouraged him; it was quite likely that he had got
into a similar condition to that of the unknown Benson; if
so it would be all right when noon came; all he had to do
was to look cheerful so that Kirk wouldn’t discover his
state. So he grinned as broadly as possible, and whistled
one of his tuneless tunes. And for a time his indisposition
really left him, or very nearly did so, and during the hour
of easy work on the river and the subsequent fifteen minutes
of starting practice he was able to work well and
even brilliantly, and was certain that his illness was past.</p>

<p>The race was down for half-past three. After work in
the shell was over and the craft was safe in the little boat-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
some half mile from the hotel, the crew and substitutes,
with the exception of the unfortunate Talbot, were
taken on a long, unhurried walk along the river under the
guidance of Kirk, who tried to keep their thoughts as much
as possible off of the coming contest. The nervousness that
had begun to make its appearance gradually subsided under
the soothing influence of quiet country lanes and wood
paths, and at twelve the fellows returned to the hotel looking
fresh and untroubled.</p>

<p>The hostelry meanwhile had filled with a merry and
excited throng of Hillton boys and graduates, and had become
a veritable blaze of crimson. Muggins was beside
himself with delight; never before had he received so much
attention; he welcomed each new arrival with frantic barks
of joy, and scampered about from one group to another,
his brilliant blanket flashing restlessly hither and thither.
Carl and Stewart and Todd and Williams and everybody
else, apparently, had come down for the race, and all was
tumult and laughter and handshaking. Old Hillton fellows
who had not met for a year or more shouted greetings to
each other across the corridor or struggled madly through
the throngs to clap each other on the back. Into this scene
pushed the returning crew, and as their presence was discovered
the crowd broke into ringing cheers, and pressed
about them, eager for a word with or a look at the youngsters
upon whose broad shoulders rested their hopes.</p>

<p>At last, however, they managed to reach the parlor on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the second floor, into whose sacred precincts admission was
denied to all else. Trevor sank into a chair with a smothered
groan. The former indisposition had returned with all
its former force, and for a moment he sat dazed and faint.
When he looked up he found Dick’s eyes upon him anxiously.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, chum?”</p>

<p>Trevor smiled with an effort.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I fancy; just a bit—a bit tired.”</p>

<p>“Well, sneak off upstairs and lie down a while, like a
good chap. We can’t have you going off, old fellow.
Talbot’s the only chap that would be fit for your place,
and he’s as limp as a rag. Take a rest before dinner.”</p>

<p>Trevor obeyed, and spent the next quarter of an hour
at full length on his bed in the room which he shared with
Dick and two others. He shut his eyes resolutely, telling
himself that he would be all right after a nap. But sleep
refused to come, and he lay and wondered over and over
whether he would be able to take his place in the boat.
If he wasn’t poor old Dick would be in a hard way, he
thought. There were three substitutes there besides Talbot,
but not one of them was accustomed to rowing at Number
4, and, for that matter, not one was fitted for the position.
All he could do, he resolved, was to fight down the
beastly sickness; once in the boat, he felt certain he would
be able to do his work. Besides, there was the case of Benson;
to be sure, it was already noon, and his fever, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of taking itself off, seemed rather to be increasing; but perhaps
he had it a little worse than Benson, and it would take
longer to disappear. He pressed his hands hard over his
forehead in a vain endeavor to ease his headache, and tried
his best to go to sleep. And then the dinner gong sounded,
and he made a hasty toilet and joined the rest in the parlor,
where a private table was spread. The meal was a sorry affair.
Even the fellows who had rowed against St. Eustace the
year before showed signs of nervousness, while some of the
less experienced were in a blue funk. Kirk worked heroically
to keep their spirits up, but it was of no avail in most cases,
and there was a palpable air of relief when the meal was
over and they were free to hide their feelings by moving
about and talking to their heart’s content. A half-hour later
the march to the boat-house was begun, and a crowd of
admirers followed in their wake. Once in their places
much of the nervousness wore off, and, cheered by the
throng on shore, Hillton’s crew paddled out into the stream
and set leisurely off for the start.</p>

<p>In the open air Trevor’s headache lessened, and he felt
much better. Dick, who had been plainly anxious about
him, found encouragement from his fresher looks and
heaved a sigh of relief. As they paddled slowly up the
river a sound of distant cheering reached them, and at a
command from Keene they rested upon their oars and
glanced up-stream and across to the St. Eustace boat-house.
The rival eight were stepping into their shell. One after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
another the blue-clad youths took their places. Then they
put out into the stream and dropped down the river toward
the Hillton boat.</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal of splashing there,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Keene watched the oncoming crew attentively.
“Yes, port side’s terribly ragged. But they look a powerful
lot. Touch her easy, Seven. That’ll do.”</p>

<p>At a little distance up-stream the St. Eustace shell made
a wide turn, the eight rowers for a moment resting upon
their oars and sending a hearty cheer across the blue water.
Hillton returned the compliment and her rival moved away
again.</p>

<p>“They look a bit heavier than us,” said Shield from
the bow of the boat.</p>

<p>“Only about a pound,” answered Dick, watching the
shell creep up-stream; “that is, according to their weights,
you know. But I’ll wager that Richardson weighs more
than a hundred and forty-five.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Wells is more than seventeen years old,”
said Taylor.</p>

<p>“I dare say. What time is it, Keene?”</p>

<p>“Five after.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go up. By Jove, fellows, what a day for
it!” Dick took a deep breath of the brisk, invigorating
air, sweet with the fragrance of lush meadows and moist
woods, and turned smilingly to Taylor. “How do you
feel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too good to describe,” answered Number 7 heartily.
“I could row ten miles instead of two.”</p>

<p>“Good boy,” said Dick. He gazed up the length of the
shell. Answering smiles met him from bright eyes and
glowing faces, save in one case. Trevor grinned broadly;
he even essayed a wink; but the grin was somewhat awry
and the wink was a poor thing. Dick frowned, and, turning,
gripped his oar with his exuberance lessened.</p>

<p>“Ready all! Forward! Paddle!”</p>

<p>The shell crept up-stream between banks sprinkled with
spectators, hurrying, in most cases, toward the finish line
or some midway point of vantage. At the start quite a
throng had assembled to see the boats get away. The Terrible,
bearing a number of Hillton representatives, chugged
alongside, and from her deck Kirk gave his last commands
in low tones to Dick and Keene. Then he spoke briefly
to the crew, and a moment later both shells backed to the
starting-line.</p>

<p>Trevor saw the throng through a light mist. With his
hands gripping the oar he stared in growing misery at the
neck of Number 5 and waited, wondering for the tenth
time how much longer the suspense would last. To the left
of him was the St. Eustace boat. The fellows were peeling
off their sweaters and some were whispering. Then
Trevor was removing his own sweater, and the referee was
talking to them about something; what it was he didn’t
know nor care. If only they would start! He heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Keene’s voice: “Get ready!” He went forward on his
slide, turned his blade square in the water, and felt it snug
against the thole-pin.</p>

<p>“I shall say ‘Are you ready?’ once; if I receive no
reply I shall say ‘Go!’”</p>

<p>The referee’s voice came through the megaphone with
sudden warning.</p>

<p>“Touch her easy, Two,” said the cox in quiet unconcerned
tones. “That’ll do; steady, Two!”</p>

<p>Trevor’s gaze, suddenly roaming to the other boat, saw
the rival cox, a red-haired, spidery-looking youth, bending
forward, his eyes alert but steady, his hands gripped tight
about the lines. The little throng near at hand had grown
quiet, almost silent. His head ached a bit, and his eyes——</p>

<p>“<em>Are you ready?</em>”</p>

<p>His heart gave a leap that threatened to choke him;
then sank quickly, suddenly; he waited—waited. Would
the word never come? The breeze was ruffling the back of
Waters’s shirt. The sun was very bright, and the small
waves reflected its rays in the manner of a thousand mirrors.
Surely the referee had——</p>

<p>“GO!”</p>

<p>There was a rush of blades through the water, a sudden
leap, a confused rattling of many oars, a seething on every
side, a shouting from bank and boats. The race was on!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>AT THE MILE</small></h2>


<p><em>Splash! Swish! Rattle!</em></p>

<p>The oars dug into the water venomously, swirled
through, emerged dripping and flashing, disappeared again.
Brown, sinewy arms shot forward and back, bodies bent and
unbent like powerful springs, the water was thrown in
little cascades of glistening pearls, and the coxswains, open-mouthed,
intense, cried unintelligible things in the uproar,
and looked like vindictive little demons crouching for a
spring. There was no long, rhythmic swing of the oars
now; there was nothing inspiring to the spectators in the
quick, dashing movements of the sweeps; all seemed without
system, incoherent.</p>

<p>Ten—eleven—twelve—thirteen—fourteen strokes!
Then the savage struggle was past, and out from the momentary
chaos of uproar and turmoil and seething water
the Hillton shell shot into the lead, its bobbing cox even
with Number Four of the St. Eustace boat.</p>

<p>“Steady all! Lengthen out! Lengthen out!”</p>

<p>The plunging dips of the eight crimson-bladed oars
ceased. Stroke, with a quick glance at the other boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
moved back to the full limit of the slide, his sweep swirled
steadily, almost slowly, through the quieter water, came out
square, turned, feathered over yards of racing ripples, and
again lost itself under the gleaming surface.</p>

<p>“<em>Time! Time!</em>” yelled cox.</p>

<p>And now backs were bending in perfect unison, oarlocks
rattled as one, and rowing superbly at thirty-two
strokes to the minute, the crimson eight forced the shining
cedar craft away until clear water showed between its rudder
and the knifelike bow of its rival. Hillton had gained
the first trick, and, although the game was by no means yet
won, Dick’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction, Keene allowed
a smile to cross his face, and on the Terrible, racing along
in the wake of the speeding shells, Professor Beck and
Coach Kirk glanced at each other and nodded. Across the
intervening tide came, shrilly, insistent, the cry of the St.
Eustace coxswain:</p>

<p>“<em>Hit her up! Hit her up! Hit her up!</em>”</p>

<p>In response eight blue-clad bodies bent and strained
in an endeavor to place their shell beside Hillton’s, and
eight blue-tipped oars flashed swiftly back and forth. St.
Eustace was rowing thirty-seven. Dick shot a glance of
inquiry at Keene. The latter glanced over his right
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Can’t keep it up,” he answered to Stroke’s unspoken
question. “<em>Four, you’re late!</em>”</p>

<p>Slowly the bow of the St. Eustace boat crept up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
them; now it was abreast of their rudder; a dozen strokes
more and it was even with cox; a minute later St. Eustace’s
bow oar was cutting the water opposite to Dick. But there
was no alteration of the latter’s stroke. For a minute or
two the Blue’s boat hung tenaciously to the place it had
won; then, inch by inch, it dropped astern again, yet so
slowly that it was long before Dick was certain that it
was so. The Blue was rowing at thirty-three now, and very
wisely husbanding her strength. The half-mile was past,
and the race was a quarter over.</p>

<p>Down at the finish crowds lined the shores and stood
packed into a restless mass on the great iron bridge that
spans the river a few rods below the imaginary line. The
scene was a bright one. Overhead the summer sky arched
warmly blue, a vast expanse of color unbroken save in the
west, where a soft bank of cumulate clouds lay one upon
the other like giant pillows. The river reflected the intense
azure of the heavens and caught the sunlight on every
ripple and wave until from long gazing upon it the eyes
were dazzled into temporary blindness. On each side the
banks were thickly wooded save that here and there a
square or quadrangle of radiant turf stretched from the
margin of the stream upward and away to some quiet mansion
leaf-embowered in the distance. The western side of
the river was deep-toned with shadows for a little space,
and there upon the bank the trees held a promise of the
twilight in their dark foliage. Up the stream, to the right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Marshall dozed in the afternoon, a picturesque group of
white buildings, studded here and there with clumps of
green; a long, low factory building stood by the water and
glowed warmly red in the sunlight. Across the river and
almost opposite to the village St. Eustace Academy
sprawled its half-dozen edifices down the southern slope of
a gentle hill, but only the higher towers and gables showed
above the big elms that stood sentinel about it.</p>

<p>Along the bridge and up and down both shores by the
finish crimson flags and streamers shone side by side with
the deep blue banners of the rival school. Gay hats and
bright-hued dresses pricked out the throngs. Field-glasses
now and then gave aid to eager eyes, and everywhere was
an atmosphere of impatience and excitement. Many nerves
were a-tingle there that sunny afternoon, while far up the
river, like thin bright streaks upon the water, the two
boats, to all appearances side by side, sped onward toward
victory or defeat. It was anybody’s race as yet, said the
watchers on the bridge; and indeed it looked so, not alone
to them, but to the spectators in the launches and tugs that
followed the shells, to the officials in their speeding craft,
to the occupants of the slender cedar racing-ships themselves—to
all save one.</p>

<p>Trevor Nesbitt, toiling over his oar with white, set face,
was alone certain that defeat was to be the harvest of the
eight heroes in crimson. But although he alone was sure, it
is possible that Keene was already scenting disaster, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
coxswain was staring ahead at Trevor with frowning brow
and anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“<em>Brace up, Four! You’re late!</em>”</p>

<p>Trevor heard the cry as one half asleep hears the summons
to awake; he wondered why cox didn’t speak louder;
but he brought his wandering thoughts back the next instant
and bore doggedly at his oar. Yes, he could still row;
one more stroke; now, yet one more; and still another. It
seemed as though each must be his last, and yet, when it was
done, strength still remained for another, weaker, slower,
but still another. Ever since the half-mile had been passed
he had been on the verge of collapse. He was faint and
weak and dizzy; the blue sky and glistening water were
merged in his failing sight into one strange expanse of
awful, monotonous blue that revolved behind him in mighty
sweeps like a monster cyclorama. Often it was dotted with
craft that trailed soft, gray vapor behind them; often the
lights were suddenly turned quite out, and the world was
left in impenetrable blackness, and he closed his eyes and
was glad.</p>

<p>“<em>Four! Four! What’s the matter? Brace up, man!</em>”</p>

<p>And then he opened his aching eyes again, slowly, unwillingly,
to find the world for the moment normal; to see
the muscles of Waters’s neck straining like cords; to see
a line of crimson bodies working back and forth; to wonder
with alarm why he was sitting there motionless when
every one else was at work, and then to suddenly discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
that he, too, was going forward and back on the slide, and
in time with the other toilers. In one such moment he
looked aside and saw a line of blue figures moving like automatons
almost even with them. He wondered if they
knew—those automatons—that they were going to win.
He could tell them, but he wouldn’t; not a word. A funny
little figure apparently sliding up and down at the stern reminded
him of a ridiculous image of a heathen god he had
once seen in a museum. It was very funny. He tried to
grin——</p>

<p>“<em>Eyes in the boat, Four!</em>” shrieked the coxswain
shrilly, angrily.</p>

<p>Trevor wondered who he was talking to. Strange that
he should talk when they were losing the race; silence—silence
like his own—would have been more fitting. There
was a sudden jerk at his arms that for the instant brought
him back to reality. He didn’t know what had happened;
possibly he had struck a snag; but he found the time again
after a fashion and worked on doggedly, as a machine
might work, with neither sensation nor spirit. He had
caught a crab, but he didn’t know it then. Suddenly
an almost overmastering hatred of the tossing blue line
across the little breadth of water surged over him. They
would win, the beasts, the monsters! And the little
heathen image that slid up and down at the end would be
happy! And Dick and Keene and all the others would
be miserable and heartbroken! Heaven, how he hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
those monsters in blue and the little red-haired heathen
image!</p>

<p>The cox was talking again now; what was it he said?
Water? Cox wanted water; surely some one could get him
water? But he had said Five, hadn’t he? Well, he wasn’t
Five, and so—— What was this? He was wet! Oh, yes,
Five was splashing him desperately with water. He wondered
why and wished he’d stop; it got into his eyes and
mouth and bothered him.</p>

<p>“Four, brace up, can’t you? It’s almost over!” pleaded
cox from a great distance.</p>

<p>What was almost over? Trevor opened his eyes and
drew his white, dripping forehead into a puzzled frown.
Oh, yes, the race! His mind and vision cleared, and he
saw things as they were; saw Keene’s eyes looking at him
despairingly, saw the cox of the St. Eustace boat slide by
him and disappear; saw the one mile buoy rush astern; saw
himself, huddled over his motionless oar that dragged,
splashing, on the surface. His brain was once more clear.
He seized the oar handle, and tried to draw it to him. It
was no use. He tried to explain it all to Keene in one
long, agonized look. Then he saw <a href="#image07">the only way by which
he could aid</a>, and summoning a semblance of strength, with
a deep breath, he reached out, and with trembling, nerveless
fingers unlocked his oar and dropped it aside. It was
lost to sight on the instant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_263">The only way by which he could aid.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“<em>Careful, Four!</em>” warned the cox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Trevor steadied himself with a hand on the gunwale,
brought his reluctant body half erect, and then flung himself
over the side. He heard the coxswain’s voice for an
instant:</p>

<p>“<em>Mind oars, Five and Seven!</em>”</p>

<p>Then the waters closed over his head.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>AT THE FINISH</small></h2>


<p>“Bow side, raise your hands!” yelled the cox. “Get
her level! Six, throw more weight out-board. That’s better!
Now hard, all! We can do it yet!”</p>

<p>Dick, with dismay at heart, had seen the rival boat
creep up and pass them, and had listened despairingly to
cox’s words:</p>

<p>“Four’s given out!”</p>

<p>Then came the command to Five to throw water over
Trevor. Dick, not daring to turn his head for an instant,
rowed on desperately, watching Keene’s face for any glimmer
of hope that might show thereon.</p>

<p>“No use,” said cox presently in low tones. “He’s a
goner! His oar’s trailing. Hello! Easy now!”</p>

<p>Dick saw the light of hope creep into the other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Mind oars, Five and Seven! Four’s gone over the
side!”</p>

<p>And then Dick caught sight of a brown arm gleaming
just under the surface, and as he once more took up the
stroke, far astern a dripping head emerged, was visible
for a moment, and again disappeared under the dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
wavelets. Dick closed his eyes, an awful horror gripping
him. Trevor had gone down!</p>

<p>“Careful, Stroke! Take your time!” cautioned
Keene.</p>

<p>Dick opened his eyes again and looked up the stream,
and hope came to him. One of the launches—it looked like
the Terrible—had crossed into the wakes of the shells. If
Trevor only came up again! Dick cried within him. And
even while his thoughts took the form of a wild, incoherent
prayer he saw the launch circle to port and stop. And when
she once more swung about the sunlight glowed on a dripping
crimson shirt.</p>

<p>“Safe!” cried Dick aloud. Keene nodded and glanced
anxiously ahead. Dick with thankful heart tugged stoutly
at his oar.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Three lengths ahead,” answered Keene. “We’re holding
them now.” He raised his voice. “Six, you’ve got to
do two men’s work now! Long and steady does it! Bow,
you’re late! Steady all!”</p>

<p>The mile buoy was far astern. St. Eustace, rowing well
at thirty-six, was, as Keene had said, three lengths in the
lead. Trevor’s dead weight and dragging oar had given
her her chance. Her crew had seen the trouble in the Hillton
shell, and, whatever their emotions were, they were
now confident of success, for a three-length lead and eight
oars to seven spelled victory for the Blue. The St. Eustace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
coxswain glanced back over his shoulder and gave a command
to the men. The distance had not increased since
the Crimson’s Number 4 had gone overboard; that wouldn’t
do. The blue-clad eight hit up their stroke. But Keene
had been watching and waiting. He would rather have
had the struggle come later, in the last half mile; but there
was no help for it.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows, ten hard ones and together! Swing
out and use your legs! One!... Two!... Three!...”</p>

<p>For the first time in the race the seven boys put every
bit of weight and muscle into their strokes. They all knew
what the words meant; St. Eustace, somewhere ahead there,
was spurting and trying to draw away; if she succeeded it
was all up with them. Backs bent and sprang, slides sped
from stop to stop, arms and legs straightened and doubled
until muscles knotted like ropes beneath tanned skin,
blades cleaved the surface like ruddy knives and emerged
yards distant to skim and flash over the swirling, racing
water for the next grip, breaths came in deep gasps, and the
shell flew forward, seeming rather to skim the surface as
a darting swallow skims the bosom of a pond, than to cleave
the glinting water.</p>

<p>“<em>Seven!... Eight!... Nine!... Ten!</em>” counted
the coxswain. “Don’t slacken! Keep her going! We’re
gaining on them hand over fist! Hard, all, hard, and use
your legs for all that’s in ’em!”</p>

<p>And gaining they were. With seven oars instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
eight, with a boat that listed plainly to bow-side, they were
gaining! St. Eustace’s coxswain looked back again; again
shrieked to his crew. But this time the response was not
evident. They were doing their best. As the beginning of
the last half-mile was reached the voice of the bobbing
figure in the stern of the St. Eustace shell came to Dick’s
ears, and his heart leaped at the sound:</p>

<p>“<em>Hit her up! Hit her up! Hit her up!</em>”</p>

<p>Dick, his face streaming with perspiration, his hands
burning on the oar-handle, peeked out of the corners of
his eyes to the left for a glimpse of the screaming cox. But
not yet. His boat was gaining, swiftly, steadily, but three
lengths is a long distance to cut down with your rivals rowing
at forty strokes to the minute.</p>

<p>“Lengthen out, Stroke!” called Keene.</p>

<p>The seven rowers steadied down and swung longer. The
mile and one half point was already far astern, and Keene
could see the faces of the crowds at the finish distinctly.
For the first time since the start he met Dick’s eyes and
smiled. Then, and as it seemed to Dick, from almost at his
side, came a shrill cry:</p>

<p>“Eyes in the boat, Seven! Finish out, Six, finish
out!”</p>

<p>It was the St. Eustace coxswain, and at the same moment
a speck trembled just within the field of Dick’s vision
at the left. The next instant it took shape; he could see
the rival boat’s rudder, a portion of the stern, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
steering lines white and gleaming in the sunlight. They
were almost even! He was conscious of a new sound, quite
distinct from the working of the slides, the rattle of the
locks and the rush of oars—a confused murmur that gradually
took shape and resolved itself into the cheering of
human voices. Surely the finish-line was at hand! He
glanced at Keene. That youth, white beneath the tan of
his face, with perspiration standing upon his forehead in
little glistening beads, was looking straight ahead, with
every thought straining toward the goal.</p>

<p>“Now, once more, all!” screamed the St. Eustace coxswain.
“Pick her up! You’re not half rowing! Five,
steady down! Four, you’re late, you’re late! Row!
Row!”</p>

<p>And then the little red-haired youth also crept into
Dick’s sight; a pale-faced, despairing figure, crouching
there in the stern, bobbing forward and back as though to
hurl his boat across the line by his own unaided efforts.
One glance at his face brought a flood of joy to Dick! St.
Eustace was already beaten—and that white-faced cox knew
it! In the next minute a qualm of pity for the struggling
opponents came to him, only to be swallowed up in a great
wave of triumph as he found himself opposite to the St.
Eustace stroke. The three lengths were gone and the two
boats were even at last!</p>

<p>The shouting from the shore was louder, and Dick could
distinguish the cheers of his schoolmates from the slogan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of St. Eustace’s supporters. But how he wished for the
end! His breath seemed gone, and every respiration shook
his body from head to feet. The perspiration on his face
had turned to little drops of ice-water. The river danced
and wavered in his sight. His arms were like bars of lead,
and his legs from hips to toes seemed no longer connected
with the upper portion of him, but were dead, benumbed;
he could have put his hand on the very place where they
had been cut off. Surely they were at the line now!
Surely it was time to get into the lead! He glanced appealingly
at Keene.</p>

<p>The latter drew the port rudder-line to him slowly for
an inch. Then he turned toward the speeding boat beside
him and looked it over, up and down; Two was splashing
badly; Four was rolling on his seat like a drunken man;
Stroke was plainly worked out; his eyes met those of the
red-haired cox; the latter glared across at him vindictively.
He turned again and ran his eyes over his own boat: Bow
was weakening, but still steady; Six was struggling blindly
with half-closed eyes; the balance of the seven were still
strong for that period of a two-mile race. He looked
ahead at the boats and the bridge above, dark with humanity.</p>

<p>“Two hundred yards!” shrieked the St. Eustace coxswain.
“Now pick her up! We’ve got the race if you’ll
only take it! Stroke, for Heaven’s sake, man, pick her up!
Row!... Row!... Row!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Two hundred yards! Dick looked at Keene; the latter
nodded. Dick rattled his hands away quickly.</p>

<p>“Hit her up all!” cried Keene. “Here’s the finish!
Row now, row for Hillton! We’ve got to win!”</p>

<p>“Now then, fellows!” gasped Dick. His blade went
under for a hard, desperate stroke, and the next moment
seven bodies were straining at the oars in a last, heroic endeavor.</p>

<p>“Well done, all! Keep it up! Keep it up! Once
more! Well rowed, fellows! Well rowed! We’re gaining!
Use your legs! Well rowed!”</p>

<p>Keene’s voice arose loud and full of encouragement.
From across the little path of intervening water came the
shrill reiterant appeals of the other coxswain:</p>

<p>“Hard! Hard! We’ve got them! Keep going! Another
stroke or two! Hard! Row hard!”</p>

<p>The air was full of the cheers of the excited watchers and
the blatant screams of the whistles of surrounding craft. To
Dick it was all a confused babel of awful sound. He had
closed his eyes, fearing to see the rival boat slipping from
sight. But now, gathering courage, he looked. They were
in a lane of assembled craft, from which arose streams and
clouds of steam; beyond the noisy gathering the river bank
was lined with moving throngs; beside him—— His heart
sank; the St. Eustace boat was gone! The little bobbing
coxswain, the toiling stroke oar, were no longer beside him!
He looked despairingly at Keene; something in the latter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
expression sent his glance beyond, and joy rushed back to
his heart. The rival boat was a length behind! He closed
his eyes again from sheer happiness, and tugged on at the
oar. The uproar was deafening, but suddenly, above it all,
he heard the coxswain’s voice:</p>

<p>“<em>Let her run!</em>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he looked up again, raising his head from his hot,
trembling hands, he found to his surprise that his eyes were
wet. They were in shadow now, and he glanced up to find
the arches of the bridge above them. The noise was less.
He blinked through wet lashes at Keene. The latter was
grinning happily, foolishly.</p>

<p>“Length and a quarter, about,” he said.</p>

<p>From the bridge overhead and from the throng beyond
came cheers for Hillton.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>TREVOR IS COMFORTED</small></h2>


<p>It was an hour short of sunset when Trevor awoke.
The room was darkened, but now and then the curtain at
the open window was stirred by the languorous breeze and
admitted a broad bar of sunlight which lengthened across
the floor and was gone again as the curtain fell back into
place. The hotel was almost silent, though at intervals the
hum of voices came subduedly to the boy in the bed, and
at times he caught the clatter of dishes.</p>

<p>For many minutes he lay quiet. Everything was very
peaceful and soothing, and he closed his eyes once more, but
only to reopen them as his mind took up his work again.
Where was he and how came he there? It wasn’t his room
at Hillton; this wasn’t his narrow iron bed; the wall-paper
was all wrong; the carpet was different, and the window
was entirely out of place. And then, too, it was much too
big, this high-ceilinged, square apartment. He raised himself
on his elbow and examined his surroundings. He was
quite alone, but on a small table beside him were two tumblers
half full of something, a pitcher, two silver spoons,
and a watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>He reached forth and drew the latter toward him. It
was his own, and its hands indicated twenty after six. His
gaze roamed about the room and fell upon a pair of canvas
rowing shoes. Then memory returned, and he sank
back upon the pillow with a groan, closing his eyes and
moving his head restlessly from side to side as his thoughts
went back over the day’s events. He remembered the
awful period in the boat; it seemed now as he looked back
upon it as though it must have been hours and hours,
though he knew that from the time of starting until he had
plunged into the river but five or six minutes could have
elapsed; he remembered a world of green, silent water
about him, a brief glare of blue sky and flashing sunlight,
many faces bending above him, and then, but very indistinctly,
a man with gray mustaches who raised him up and
made him swallow something.</p>

<p>He was rather tired and listless now, but his headache
was gone and his fever had passed away, and—yes, he felt
pretty well. Perhaps he had best get up and dress himself;
it would soon be time to return to Hillton. If only some
one would come and tell him. But of course no one cared
much about him now; how could they? It was natural that
he should be left alone, he who had lost the race for Hillton.
He sighed and clenched his hands above the white
spread. What must they think of him? His cheeks reddened
at the thought of facing Dick and Kirk and all the
others. Of course, Dick would make light of it, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
sure that Kirk would carefully abstain from saying anything
to hurt his feelings; and perhaps the other fellows
would be very decent about it. But in their hearts they must
hate him; it was only natural. He was glad that the school
year was almost over; perhaps next year it would be partly
forgotten; perhaps he needn’t return to Hillton at all!</p>

<p>Suddenly, from a little distance, came a sound of noisy
laughter. He frowned. How could any one laugh, he
wondered indignantly. The thought came to him that
maybe some one down there had spoken his name, and he
felt his face burning hotly with shame. He turned over
and laid his head on his arm and closed his eyes wearily.
He wished Muggins was there. It was very still again. A
long tremor shook him and he felt a tiny scorching tear
roll down his cheek. He brushed it away quickly, but another
took its place, and still another, and presently, while
the sunlight moved from the western window, he fell asleep
again.</p>

<p>When next he woke the room was in twilight darkness,
although the curtain had been rolled away from the open
window. There were two figures by the little table, and
he heard low voices:</p>

<p>“Is he awake?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. It’s time for his medicine, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, shall I wake him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Let’s wait a minute or two.”</p>

<p>The figures moved across the room and darkened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
square of the casement. Trevor laid very still; perhaps
they would go away again if he feigned sleep. He could
hear them conversing softly, but couldn’t distinguish their
words because—because there was such a noise outside!
What was it? He could hear shouting and sometimes the
blare of a band. It must be at the front of the hotel. St.
Eustace was celebrating her victory probably, and Hillton’s
defeat! He groaned and tossed an arm despairingly. One
of the figures turned and walked toward him.</p>

<p>“Awake, Trevor?”</p>

<p>It was Dick’s voice. For a moment Trevor was silent;
then he answered with a sigh:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The second figure came and leaned over him and he
saw that it was Kirk.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling now, chum?” asked Dick, with
all the old affection in his voice. Trevor felt his eyes
growing moist, and he had to gulp twice before he could
answer.</p>

<p>“All right, Dick; I think I can get up now.”</p>

<p>“Get up! Indeed, you’ll not. You’re to stay here to-night,
and I’m going to stay with you. The others are
getting ready to go back now; can you hear them?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see what the boy looks like,” said Kirk. “I’ll
light the gas and give him his medicine.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, please don’t!” cried Trevor. It was all so
much easier in the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” Kirk answered cheerfully. “I dare say
it would hurt your eyes. But here’s the stuff. Open your
mouth.”</p>

<p>Trevor obeyed, and after several misadventures the
medicine was administered. Dick had seated himself on the
side of the bed and had taken one of the other lad’s hands
in his own.</p>

<p>“Trevor.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“A length and a third, old chap!”</p>

<p>Trevor sighed, and then, “I—I suppose it might have
been worse, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Worse?” cried Dick. “What are you talking about?
Why, we’re awfully proud of it, every one of us! Aren’t
we, Mr. Kirk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we have good cause, I think. It was magnificent!”</p>

<p>“And, Trevor,” went on Dick in tones so full of happiness
that Trevor wondered, “all the fellows want you
to hurry up and get well; and we all cheered you at dinner
till the plaster nearly fell on us!”</p>

<p>“Cheered me!” whispered Trevor. “Cheered me,
Dick? Do you mean—do you mean that they—that you all
forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Forgive you? What for? Because you were the
pluckiest of any of us and did the brainiest sort of thing
when you jumped overboard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because—oh, Dick, don’t you see? If I hadn’t been
so bull-headed it wouldn’t have happened; if I’d owned up
that I wasn’t feeling well you could have put another fellow
in. But I heard Mr. Kirk telling about some fellow
who had the fever and how it left him at noon; and I
thought mine would, too; and so I went ahead, and—and
it didn’t go away, but got worse every minute; I was all
silly in my head. And—don’t you see, Dick, if I’d done
right we wouldn’t have been beaten?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then—</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know!” said Kirk softly.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” whispered Dick. “Of course he doesn’t;
how could he? Thunder, how stupid of me!” He laughed
softly, happily. “Trevor, old chap, we weren’t beaten!
Don’t you understand? We won!”</p>

<p>There was a second brief silence. Then—</p>

<p>“Won!” breathed Trevor, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, by a length and a third. I told you, don’t you
remember? But you didn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You—you’re just saying it to—to make me feel
better,” doubted Trevor.</p>

<p>“No, honestly, chum; we won. Mr. Kirk will tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nesbitt, we won finely; there’s no doubt about
that. Listen.”</p>

<p>From below, through the open window, came the martial
strains of a band; Trevor recognized the tune; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
“Hilltonians.” And then, faintly but distinctly, came a
hoarse voice:</p>

<p>“Now, fellows! Once more! Three times three for
Hillton!”</p>

<p>The music was blotted out by a mighty cheer that arose
to the starlit sky in a roar of triumph. Trevor was glad
of the darkness, for there were tears in his eyes that threatened
every moment to overflow; but they were tears of
happiness, and somehow those didn’t count.</p>

<p>“And—and they don’t mind that I—that I did what
I did?” whispered Trevor. “They don’t hate me for it,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Hate you!” cried Dick. “Hark!”</p>

<p>Through the casement, a gray rectangle of twilight,
the strained voice of the leader again floated:</p>

<p>“Now, fellows! Fellows! Once more for Nesbitt, and
all together! One—two——”</p>

<p>And while the hoarse, joyful cheers responded, and the
bass-drum thumped triumphantly, Trevor, with his hand
tightly clasped in Dick’s, laid his head back very contentedly
upon the pillow.</p>

<p class="noi adtitle">The New Boy at Hilltop</p>

<p class="noi addesc">Illustrated in Colors, Ornamental Cloth Cover with Inlay

<p>The story of a boy’s experiences at boarding school. The first
chapter describes his arrival and reception by the others. The remaining
chapters tell of his life on the football field, on the crew, his various
scrapes and fights, school customs and school entertainments. His
experiences are varied and cover nearly all the incidents of boarding
school life.</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">Winning His “Y”</span></p>

<p class="noi addesc">Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Decorated Cloth Cover, $1.50.</p>

<p>The scene of this story is Yardley Hall, the school made famous in
“Double Play” and “Forward Pass!”; and we meet again the manly,
self-reliant Dan Vinton, his young friend Gerald Pennimore, and many
others of the “old boys” whose athletic achievements and other doings
have been so entertainingly chronicled by Mr. Barbour. The new story
is thus slightly connected with its predecessors, but will be fully as interesting
to a boy who has not read them as if it were not.</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">Double Play</span></p>

<p class="noi addesc">Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>Further experiences of Dan Vinton—hero of “Forward Pass!”—at
Yardley Hall. He becomes in a way the mentor of the millionaire’s
son, Gerald Pennimore, who enters the school. There is the description
of an exciting baseball game, and the stratagem by which the wily
coach, Payson, puts some ginger into an overtrained squad and develops
from it a winning team will appeal to every boy.</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">Forward Pass!</span></p>

<p class="noi addesc">Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>In his new story, Mr. Barbour returns to the field of his earlier
and more successful stories, such as “The Half-Back,” “Captain of
the Crew,” etc. The main interest in “Forward Pass!” centers about
the “new” football; the story is, nevertheless, one of preparatory-school
life and adventures in general. The book contains several
illustrations and a number of diagrams of the “new” football plays.
Mr. Barbour considers this his best story.</p>

<p>A third story by the author of “Butt Chanler, Freshman,” and
“The New Sophomore,” in which the heroes of those stories are
again in evidence with other and new characters of equal interest.
In his latest story, Mr. Hamilton takes up the life of upper classmen.
The story has all of the close knowledge of life at college
and in a small college town that has marked Mr. Hamilton’s former
books, and there is also a wider and broader view befitting his
older characters as they come in contact with the bigger world
outside.</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">The New Sophomore</span></p>

<p class="noi addesc">Illustrated in Colors. Inlay in Colors on Cover, 12mo,

<p>The story of Butt Chanler’s sophomore year, but with a new
member of Butt’s class for hero. Plot counts more than in the
former story; for a strong detective interest centers around a
statue of a river goddess, hidden by one class while the other
attempts to find and capture it. The hero, after accidentally putting
the “enemy” on the trail of the goddess, finally saves her
by his ingenuity.</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">Butt Chanler, Freshman</span></p>

<p class="noi addesc">Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Decorated Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>“Butt” Chanler is a freshman, and the story begins with the

successful baseball seasons the college has ever known. There
are all the events of a freshman’s life that a boy loves to look
forward to and the graduate to look back upon.</p>

A rare Portrait of Lewis Carroll as a young man as Frontispiece.
Small 12mo, Cloth, $1.25 net.</p>

<p>This is a very charming biography of the man who wrote “Alice in
Wonderland.” Miss Moses, whose “Louisa May Alcott” proved so
remarkably sympathetic an account of an interesting woman, has in her
new book written what is, perhaps, the best and most spontaneous
account ever published of a man of the most interesting personality and
genius. There is more here than has ever elsewhere appeared of the
younger days of Lewis Carroll, while Miss Moses’s imaginative sympathy
has made a most enthusiastic history of the better-known period
of the career of the author of “Alice in Wonderland.”</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">Louisa May Alcott</span></p>

<p class="noi addesc">By <span class="smcap">Belle Moses</span>. 12mo, Cloth, Illustrated, $1.25 net.</p>

<p>This is an admirable story of the childhood and womanhood of the
celebrated author of “Little Women,” told with especial reference to
girl readers. Miss Moses has excellently caught the beautiful home
spirit of the Alcotts’s family circle, and this biography is not only charmingly
written but is in every way an authoritative account of the interesting
life of Miss Alcott and the New England scenes in which her days
were spent. It has been Miss Moses’s desire to give an intimate picture
of the home life of her heroine, her development of character, and the
influence upon her of the famous band of New England men and women
who made Concord and Boston centers of intellectual growth.</p>

In this story Mr. Altsheler has again conducted his now famous band of

<p>Mr. Hill, who is known as an absolutely accurate, authentic
writer of American history and biography, has planned
this book to give in interesting, readable form, suitable for
young boys and girls, an accurate account of George Washington,
not as a dignified President of the United States,
but first as a child in his home, then as a boy in his adventurous
surveying expeditions, and finally as a young man
fighting with and later commanding troops in the American
Revolution.</p>

perilous situations which are turned to the boy’s advantage
